# If you add advisortypes, and use those tags, do not change them without changing everywhere they are used.
#
# Additional arguments: allow_only_male/allow_only_female
# Contains skill_scaled_modifier for which the effects get multiplied by the advisor's skill level
# Uses all 'modifiers' possible that are exported as a Modifier.

# Note that ai_will_do calculates a priority.
# An advisor may be chosen over another if its random priority exceeds it. RandomPriority(advisor) := rand[1, 2[ * Priority(advisor).
