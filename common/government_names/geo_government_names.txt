#"Autokrator" is a Byzantine imperial title, adopted by Georgian Sovereigns ("Tvitmpkrobeli" in Georgian). I have decided to leave it in original form. "Basileus" was also used by the Georgian Sovereigns, but less freaquently, than, "Autokrator". Georgian language is genderless, so both male and female sovereigns would use the same title.
