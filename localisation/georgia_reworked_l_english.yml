 geo_boost_militarization:0 "Boost Militarization"
 geo_boost_militarization_desc:0 "Technically, the history of Georgia is the history of wars and bloodshed, against both internal and external enemies. All-encompassing and near incessant warfare has made Georgian society heavily militarized, with nearly everything from culture to even cuisine centered around the warfare and majority of the population nearly constantly having weapons by their side, ready to follow their sovereign in war. While this indeed helped the relatively small country to survive and win against the invaders, at the same time it decimated the economy and usually made the country highly unstable, which had far-reaching consequences for the nation and its development.\n "
 geo_total_mobilization:0 "Kudze Katsi"
 geo_total_mobilization_desc:0 "'Kudze Katsi' means 'Every Man with a Hat', that is, every adult male in the country. While initially being a relatively general term, it later has essentially become the Georgian equivalent of 'Levée en Masse', the call for every able-bodied Georgian male to the military campaign. Technically, the defense of the realm and the general population was the obligation of the nobility, as it was common in the rest of feudal Europe. However, later on, as Georgia faced more rampant and frequent wars, this system essentially collapsed and the sovereigns would sometimes call as many able-bodied males as possible during the wars. This would naturally mean that the peasants and workers couldn't work at their jobs at the time, so this was usually a desperate measure for rapid responses against the ongoing threats.\n "

Asides from being an administrative designation, 'Satsikhistavo' was also a special tax paid by the populace to finance the sustenance of the Fortification. Thanks to this, fortifications were usually kept in decent shape despite the constant turmoil and thus eased the country's wars. With that being said, the additional tax burden had a heavy toll on the local populace, that wasn't really prosperous as it was.\n "

More or Less modeled after the Western and Russian systems, as part of the reform, every able-bodied male was required to serve for a certain amount of time in this New Model Army, with his equipment and foodstuff. This played a crucial part in stabilizing the realm and enhancing the defensive capabilities of the country against both the organized enemy forces and the marauding bands, while the limited and regulated time of service would ensure that the people would not be distracted from their work for too long for it to have it more severe impact on the Economy.\n "

This was by far the most burdensome issue for the Georgians, as unlike facing the actual enemy armies, these smaller and more mobile bands were difficult to spot and rapidly respond to. For this reason, the villages and towns in the country were orgnaized into 'Samdeveros', where under the local commanders, the local millitia of 'Mdevaris', or 'Pursuers' would hunt down and deal with the marauding bands in mind. This provided the excellent part of the larger guerilla warfare in the defensive wars against invaders.\n "

He, under royal instructions, traveled to the west to seek an alliance with Christian European powers against the Persians and the Ottomans. He met with Pope Clement IX and King of France Louis XIV, who promised him to aid Georgia in its wars against the Mohammedans. \n\nThis wasn’t without a price, however: Orbeliani promised that Georgia would recognize Papal primacy, which was opposed by the Georgian Orthodox Church. In addition to this, Louis XIV gave up the ghost soon after the agreement, so the promise didn’t come to effect.

He also translated European scientific treatises of natural sciences (most notably Physics) into Georgian, which was thought later at Georgian Seminaries.\n\n However, his friendly relations with the members of the Catholic Capuchin Order led to him suspecting him of being a secretly Catholic, which was used by his enemies to dethrone and exile him. However, he managed to cleanse himself from these accusations in Russian Empire and was appointed as Bishop of Vladimir, during the Reign of Catherine “The Great”.

However, after the Mongol Invasions, the Georgian state was involved in devastating wars against the invading nomads. Thus, the potential Liberation of Jerusalem from the Mohammedans became a distant perspective.\n\n The times of troubles are in the past, however, as our fully recovered and rising empire captured the holy land and the holy city of Jerusalem. No doubt, this feat shall earn us great respect throughout the entire Christendom. However, we could, in theory, declare our recent victories as of late fulfillment of our distant promises for the Pope of Rome and Restore the Crusader Kingdom.

We could directly administer these lands and resettle some of the Gothic population in the provinces with less loyal groups. On the other hand, our advisors also think that we should draw from an historical experience of the Georgian state and create a protectorate over these lands.

Strengthening of the nobility and rivalry between different members of the Royal dynasty threatens the Country with collapse.\n\nHoping to lessen the disruptive powers of regional nobles, such as the autonomous Atabegs of §YSamtskhe§! Alexander I of Georgia abdicated in 1442 and made his sons co-rulers over the constituent parts of the kingdom. This way he secured the §YBagrationi§! dynasty's standing, but it didn't aid the situation, with the potential crisis threatening to tear the country apart.\n\n A very concerning news reaches the Kingdom, about the §YOttomans§! defeating the Crusader army at Varna, leaving the §YConstantinople§! virtually defenseless. If the city will fall at the hands of the Turks, it will have a devastating effect on Georgia, isolating us from the rest of Christendom and further escalating the turmoil."

 #Monarchical
 georgian_principality_reform:1 "Georgian Principality"
 georgian_principality_reform_desc:0 "Large Georgian Principalities emerged after the general weakening of the central government in the kingdom. The incessant warfare both against rivaling Georgian polities and the invading Muslim forces resulted in a formation of a heavily militarized society, where every able man is sleeping with weapons under their bedsheets, constantly ready to follow their sovereign in war, when necessary."
 georgian_monarchy_reform:1 "Georgian Monarchy"
 georgian_monarchy_reform_desc:0 "The Georgian Monarchy is a result of a combination of ancient Georgian institutions, Roman and Byzantine influence, and a near-constant state of war against the much larger rivaling forces. Georgian Monarchs traditionally employed diverse administration of their realm, often forming vassalized buffer states around the Kingdom Proper."

 sadrosho_reform_mon_desc:0 "Local nobility have proven to be generally unruly and often entrenched themselves in the lands they governed, often making those lands their hereditary possessions.

 karavi_reform_desc:1 "Establishing 'Karavi' ('Tent') as an organ that would oppose the monarch's unlimited power was originally an idea that appeared during the reign of Queen Tamar.
