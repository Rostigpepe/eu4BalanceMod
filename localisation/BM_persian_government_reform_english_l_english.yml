satrapies_persia_desc:0 "In ancient Persia, a Satrap was a appointed viceroy of the Persian king, either of Persian or local origin, who'se task was to govern 'districts' of the Empire. The Satraps regulated and sometimes controlled the local government, collected taxes, solved legal disputes, and maintained order. The Satraps often allowed the local people to mainain their customs and beliefs as long as they paid their taxes and did not cause unrest in the districts. By adopting this system of governance, albeit modernising it, we can more effectively gain tax from our subjects, as well as making our own administration more efficient."
