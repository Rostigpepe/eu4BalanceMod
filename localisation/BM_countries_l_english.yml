 CAE.1.t: "The Confederation Act"
 CAE.1.d: "The Elbian Confederation has been declared and is now at a crossroads, a decision must be made regarding the direction of the state. We can either choose to Germanize our court and government or maintain the current Slavic dominance. Westward expansion of the confederation would be easier as a Germanized state whereas we our prospects to the east are better as a Slavic state. No matter which direction we choose the future looks bright for the Elbian Confederation!"
 CAE.1.a: "Western Route: Germanize"
 CAE.1.b: "Eastern Route: Remain Slavic"
 
 CAE.3.t: "The issue of the Czechs"
 CAE.3.d: "Ever since Bohemia was absorbed into the confederation the question of the language barrier between the Czechs and the Germans has been much discussed. A solution has been proposed and currently the [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] must decide if the Czechs are to be Germanized or if we will leave the situation as it is. Germanizing the Czechs will undoubtedly cause some dissent among the population but it will bring the people of the Elbian Confederation closer together in the end. Whichever way we will take, a decision must be made now."

Now that we have taken ownership of this historic city a conferance has been called to discuss the future of the Baltic Germans.\n\nThe conferance was attended by many prominent Germans from all over Livonia, Curonia and Estonia. During the many speeches a strong desire for unification of the Baltic Germans was expressed by many attendees who pleaded for the creation of a Baltic German state.\n\nIf such a state were to be created it could claim suzerainty over all Baltic Germans. Pushing such extensive claims would however sour diplomatic relations with other powers in the region significantly."

 belgium_nation_title: "Belgian Independence?"
 belgium_nation_desc: "The Dutch think so highly of themselves and the French pressure our people from the west and south, and still the Germanic people to our southeast encroach on our position in Europe. What are the Flemish and Walloon people supposed to do when they feel that no ther state around them treats them as an equal part of matters? Politics on both a communal level and a state level have continued to glaze over the fact that the Flemish and Walloon people toil away without end, but with new ideas spreading and political opportunities coming about, we need to seek an independent state for both people groups."

 BGM_ideas: "Belgian Ideas"
 BGM_ideas_start: "Belgian Traditions"
 BGM_ideas_bonus: "Belgian Ambition"
 the_belgian_revolution: "Subjects No More"
 the_belgian_revolution_desc: "We have toiled under unjust authority for far too long, have we not? And what were the fruits of our labor despite the unjust burdens put upon us? Freedom and glory! Though it was hard to gain the status we currently hold and many may not like us currently, we can build up from where we are and build a solid state that listens to its people and represents them fairly."
 distinct_from_dutch_and_french: "Distinct, yet Familiar"
 distinct_from_dutch_and_french_desc: "Belgium is a mish-mash of two distinct though familiar cultures in the region the Low Countries. The Walloon people come from the lands of France whilst the Flemish people come from the Netherlands, though both have felt just how horrible things can be when the governing body if ineffective in every single way possible. Now is the time for both Flemish and Walloon to flourish into a truly charismatic and prestigous state that can stand out amongst European states as one that seeks both righteous governance and honest diplomacy."
 refusal_of_pure_despotism: "The Cracking of Monarchies"
 refusal_of_pure_despotism_desc: "Belgium's inception is something of bell ringing out all across Europe: the age of monarchs ruling with absolute power is not an age that will last forever. Some dynasties and leaders think the sun will shine on them until the end of time, but Belgium is almost living proof that the authority of despotism cannot go on forever without revolution from beneath later on. From this point on, Belgium must be a bastion of reform and compromise in its highest levels of office, even if we choose to have a monarch in power."
 shift_to_flemish_and_walloon_language: "Promote Flemish and Walloon"
 shift_to_flemish_and_walloon_language_desc: "French has been the traditional language of our court and official documents for a while now, but hanging on to the French identity through their language is only going to make Belgian politics more and more messy as time goes on. We should start shifting toward using Walloon and Flemish as the standard language of our courts so that we better represent our own people and we aren't leaning so hard on the traditions of others."
 as_thrifty_as_any_dutchmen: "Business is Business"
 as_thrifty_as_any_dutchmen_desc: "Though the Flemish may be seen by the Dutch in the Netherlands as 'lower' Dutchmen, the Flemish can do just as well with regards to trade negotiations and making a good profit. If our rivals want to compete against Belgian interests in markets around Europe and outside of Europe, then we will give them no quarter and ensure that all profits stream back to us whenever possible."
 satiate_german_and_french_minorities: "Minor Cultures of Belgium"
 satiate_german_and_french_minorities_desc: "Those who are distinctly French and German are easy to spot in Belgian land since they do not identify with Walloon or Flemish people and will make that fact known if counted in a census of any sort. These minorities should be rightfully accounted for and given some form of representation so that there is good communication between the minor groups of people in Belgium and the administration itself."
 high_level_diplomacy: "A Look in the Mirror"
 high_level_diplomacy_desc: "As we settle our internal affairs and seek out both alliances and trade treaties with states around us, we need to always be mindful of how we look to foreign powers. Is Belgium overstepping its limits? How does our military seem to foreigners near to us? These are just a couple questions our diplomats and officials should keep in mind when conducting diplomacy since it can help determine how we should be doing things inside our nation."

 illyrian_nation_desc: "Subjugation by outside forces is nothing new to South Slavs as the Ottomans, the Hungarians, and those of the Holy Roman Empire have sought out dominance of the Balkans for generations now. Yet they cannot stamp out the great embers burning within the hearts of every South Slav around! Whether they are descendants of the great Serbian Empire, the noble Bulgarian Empires, the precariously placed Bosnian Kingdom, the contested Croatian Kingdom, the great League of Lezhe, or even the small Slovene communities to the north, there will be one who will rise up amongst the warring factions and unite the South Slavs into a single political entity."

 ILY_ideas_start: "Illyrian Traditions"
 ILY_ideas_bonus: "Illyrian Ambition"
 many_governments_but_one_authority: "Many Governments, but One Authority"
 many_governments_but_one_authority_desc: "Ranging from the Tsars of Bulgaria to the Bans of Croatia and Bosnia and even toward the despots of Serbia, the various people of Illyria have known many governing bodies over the course of their history. South Slavic people have never stood truly united under one administration and to this day, we struggle sometimes in organizing Illyrian finances and projects because of the strongly rooted identities of each group. But where we have succeeded is in cultivating a much more formalized system of multiple smaller governments set across the territories we control, all under one strongly bureaucratic administration that seeks to overcome the differences from each South Slavic subgroup."
 in_brotherhood_as_we_are_in_statehood: "In Brotherhood, there is Hope"
 in_brotherhood_as_we_are_in_statehood_desc: "The bonds that we have and are continuing to forge as we continue building up Illyria are bonds that no mere invasion or rebellion can break apart. The brotherhood between Croatians, Bosnians, Serbians, Bulgarians, Slovenes, and Montenegrins grows stronger by the month as they all work together to help propel Illyria not only to international prominence, but also unprecedented unity across the Balkans. To defend this unity and to serve Illyria so that the South Slavs may never be divided up again by foreign powers, that is where true honor and glory rests, and all Illyrians know that as a fact."
 illyrian_economics: "Silver & Gold Lined Illyria"
 illyrian_economics_desc: "The mines of the Balkans are rich in the ores they can produce, that much is true, but the rise in banking and mercantile theories across Europe has led to many prominent thinkers of Serbian, Croatian, Bulgarian, and Bosnian descent to question our economic practices as a whole. If we hope to answer these questions in full with sound economic policy, we will need to manage the ores that come out of these mines of ours since increasing silver and gold production could lead to Illyria either becoming a true economic power in Europe, or it could lead to the complete collapse of our own state."
 stability_brings_prosperity_to_illyria: "Rebirth of Balkan Prosperity"
 stability_brings_prosperity_to_illyria_desc: "The last time the Illyrian people had a serious period of stability and prosperity was during the reign of Stefan Lazarevic (1402-1427) in the Serbian Despotate, but this is the same for the other South Slavs across the Balkans. Now that Illyria is founded and the Balkans are coming to peace with each other in spite of what the Ottoman Empire has tried to do, we can renew the great days of Stefan Lazarevic and others who brought prosperity to the lands of the Balkans; we will see internal development and construction on a scale our ancestors could only imagine."
 hajduks_and_hussars: "Hajduks & Hussars!"
 hajduks_and_hussars_desc: "Irregulars of rural areas are becoming normal in the ranks of Illyrian regiments, and so are the swift yet fierce hussars we have cultivated over the past decades. Gone are the days where we relied on poorly equipped levies of peasants and heavily armored knights to take to the field; we of Illyria are heading forth into the future with new stratagies in mind that revolve around lighter and more mobile regiments. This steady change in strategy should also help out logistical matters across the Balkans as well, but only time will tell if that is the case."
 modernize_dusans_code: "New Political Climates"
 modernize_dusans_code_desc: "Dusan's Code was made in about 1349 under the authority of Stefan Uros IV Dusan of the Serbian Empire and for many in Illyria, it is a prime example of just how forward thinking the laws of the various Balkan polities could be. Still though, we are finding more and more aspects of it that are outdated as we continue to progress forth with new ideas and innovations coming about in Illyria today. Modernizing parts of it and getting the approval of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox clergy will certainly help keep the Illyrian administration up-to-date, and we can adapt the code to new and changing standards throughout all of Illyria."
 religion_and_politics_inside_illyria: "Illyria's Lasting Legacy"
 religion_and_politics_inside_illyria_desc: "Our roots are in that of the Balkan people of generations past and their profound commitment to Eastern Orthodoxy, specifically the Balkan Orthodox Church. It has helped and hindered politics in the past, but it has never lost its importance to the people of Serbia, just like how the churches of Bulgaria haven't lost influence with the Bulgarian people. If we can mend the tensions between these various Orthodox churches and also the Catholic bishops and priests of the Balkans, then we will certainly see a more effective administration come forth inside Illyria as a whole."

 #RHEINLAND

 REN_ADJ: "Rhenish"
 rhineland_nation_title: "The Lands Between"
 rhineland_nation_desc: "Lowly tarnished are we in the eyes of other states since we are far from the sources of power in the Holy Roman Empire like Vienna, Prague, or Munich, but we know that there is plenty of power to be had in these far lands, the lands between French and German realms. Through utilizing the power of electors of Rhenish descent and the use of the Palatinate to help stabilize our position in the Holy Roman Empire, we will be able to unite these lands into one single polity that can stand up to the likes of the would-be elden lords around us."

 REN_ideas: "Rhenish Ideas"

 elden_rings: "Shatter the Elden Ring"
 elden_rings_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire is a constantly shifting realm with powerful individuals, their families, and their armies, trying to edge out every other state so that they can be the most powerful. To compound this power, several imperial circles have formed over the years that encompass various dukes and bishops alike, yet we of the Rhineland see that these imperial circles can be transcended past. Any circle trying to involve us will be shattered without mercy and we will be beholden to only who we deem fit for leadership, even if it isn't the Holy Roman Emperor."
 we_elect_and_we_protect: "Business with the Thrones"
 we_elect_and_we_protect_desc: "Just as other bishops and dukes see it as their business to influence various states around them, we too have our own ways of doing as such as well. Our diplomatic channels run through various theocracies and small states that were once connected to the previously independent realms of the Rhineland, but now those states must make business with a unified Rhenish state. The time to do business with these thrones is now."
 religious_divergences_throughout: "Spread of the Frenzied Flame"
 religious_divergences_throughout_desc: "Unleashed by Martin Luther thanks to the terribly corrupt systems of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation presents to the entirety of Europe an infectious flame of frenzy that turns father against son, mother against daughter, duke against duke, and even bishops against fellow bishops. Rarely anything is sacred in these frenzied times, meaning that we Rhenish people need to sort out the theological questions presented us before we succumb to internal religious strife."
 frankish_immigrants: "Visitors to the Lands Between"
 frankish_immigrants_desc: "Our proximity is close to the realm of the French and we are keenly aware of just how many french families we get visiting and settling down within Rhenish territory. Many influential families in the Rhineland can trace part of their origins to the land of the Franks, which means we can't discriminate against them in any serious way without hurting ourselves. Instead we should be welcoming to these visitors to the 'lands between' the Holy Roman Empire's heartland and the heart of the Frankish realm; they can even provide us with cheaper court services."
 defenders_of_the_rings_and_leagues: "The Flame of Ambition"
 defenders_of_the_rings_and_leagues_desc: "Emboldened by the flame of ambition, our own soldiers are ready and willing to take up arms to defend this unified Rhenish state. We cannot let down our guard as the shattering of elden rings by us and others makes for powerful rivals both near and far, no, we will stand firm and ready for whatever comes at us!"
 growth_through_the_once_free_cities: "Let us Learn Together"
 growth_through_the_once_free_cities_desc: "Through the conjoining of various theological ideas, philosophical concepts, and also various pieces of land into one unified state that does not abide by the fragmentation that was so common in the past generations of the Holy Roman Empire, we of the Rhineland are growing more prosperous and bountiful by the year. Soon enough, we'll be an economic heart that very few will be able to live without, let along fight back against if relations break down."
 empowered_position_along_the_rhine: "Very Welcome Customers"
 empowered_position_along_the_rhine_desc: "And what can we say about the river we take our very name from, the Rhine itself. One of the largest rivers in all of Europe and with several large cities at its banks (Cologne, Rotterdam, and Strasbourg just to name a few), it is no wonder that we are starting to garner more and more customers over time as the importance of the river becomes paramount to several dukes and lords. Being that we hold a great deal of land along the banks of the Rhine, we are in a prime position to profit from river traders and merchants."

 #LOMBARD LEAGUE

 LML_ADJ: "Lombard League"
 lombard_league_nation_title: "Evoca la Lega Lombarda"
 lombard_league_nation_desc: "The power of the Holy Roman Empire is waning more and more, but still the successive emperors have tried their hands at keeping the cities of the Italian Peninsula loyal and obedient. Fractured and disunited for a long time now, there has been little in the way of a confederation like the old Lombard League of the 1200s to stop the Holy Roman Empire's influences, but that memory of the league is certainly not lost on us nor the people of Milan, Verona, Ferrara, and many other cities. Perhaps it is time that we summon the Lombard League once more?"

 in_defense_of_the_peninsula_desc: "The Italian Peninsula is rife with disruptions what with the Pope wanting power and various minor dukes and officials wanting power as well, but if there is one thing we are unified in, it is in defending the peninsula from foreign influence and aggression, especially when it comes the north. The Lombard League will stand tall and ready to defend the northern part of the peninsula once more!"
 papal_sanctioned_protection: "Sanctioned Defense"
 papal_sanctioned_protection_desc: "The Pope sanctioned our defense of the Italian Peninsula from the Holy Roman Empire's Frederick I and Frederick II, thus giving our military more justification and legitimacy when they took to the various walled cities to defend against invading armies of the Holy Roman Empire. The defense of the peninsula will of course be sanctioned once more should it be necessary, and even if the Pope cannot sanction us right at the time we need it, a cardinal or bishop will do just as well."
 cities_opposed_to_the_hre: "Opposition to the Holy Roman Empire"
 cities_opposed_to_the_hre_desc: "Those inside the Holy Roman Empire who stand against expanding influence of the emperor are mostly of Italian descent since our identity and culture is far different from places such as Bavaria, Saxony, and Verden. Though it will be tough to properly coordinate politics and military affairs amongst the various Italian cities of the north, we can be sure that if we succeed in coordinating a unified strategy for our combined military forces, there will be none who can break the Lombard League."
 beyond_driot_de_regale: "Beyond the Driot de Regale"
 beyond_driot_de_regale_desc: "The Peace of Constance in 1183 established a compromise between Italian cities and the emperor of Holy Roman Empire wherein, the cities would retain a level of autonomy (driot de regale) in exchange for loyalty to the emperor. This agreement is long forgotten by many people in the heart of the Holy Roman Empire, but Italian cities remember it dearly. There will be more than just autonomy for the Italian cities, there will be independence with Italians governing themselves!"
 turn_over_any_imperial_ban: "An Imperial Ban is Nothing"
 turn_over_any_imperial_ban_desc: "When Emperor Frederick II tried to gain more power in the peninsula, he issued an Imperial Ban on the Lombard League wand waged war against it back then. This is seen by us as a badge of honor instead of a mark of shame as we fought back bravely against the armies of the Holy Roman Empire and won at the Siege of Parma in 1248! Let others who oppose the central power of the Holy Roman Empire join our effort to dismantle it!"
 reform_the_universitas: "Reform the Universitas"
 reform_the_universitas_desc: "The 'universitas' of the old Lombard League was a council that consisted of representatives appointed by individual municipalities; it voted via a majority on various matters like new members being admitted and whether to wage continued war or strive for peace with the Holy Roman Empire. Reforming this representative part of our government will help keep the spirit of republican ideals alive and well."
 customs_union_and_trade_privleges: "Refine the Customs Union"
 customs_union_and_trade_privleges_desc: "Whilst the Lombard League has traditionally been a decentralized confederation of sorts overall, the past iterations of it saw the creation of a customs union that handled matters of trade much more effectively than smaller trade guilds used to. If we can build upon that foundation of a customs union and refine it as time goes on with better business practices, the Lombard League may indeed be more profitable when united like this."

 AF.3.d: "Ever since the establishment of the first permanent outpost in South Africa the government of these settlements has been a hot topic at court in [This.Capital.GetCapitalName].

By granting local governance to our South African possesions we could establish it as a settler colony greatly increasing the potential benefits of the land."
