 BM_starting_buffs_fra.1.d:0 "There have always been soldiers motivated more by pay than by their cause. In current war we are embroiled in against England, many men are flocking across the Alps into French service. One of these men is a certain Jvars Zurbuchen, a Swiss mercenary captain. He has come to our court offering his expertise."

 BM_starting_buffs_eng.2.t:0 "The Calm Before The Storm"
 BM_starting_buffs_eng.2.d:0 "The 100 Years Wars has come to an uneasy truce in the treaty of Tours. This has granted us the ability to plan our next moves. Though the treaty dictates that we are to hand over Maine peacefully to the French, what's stopping them taking the rest of our holdings later or even outright declaring war on us before we've gotten the time to react. Many nobles and statesmen are fearing that we are on the brink of war and must prepare accordingly. The English garrisons in Normandy and Gascony are urging us to fortify the region further and focus on the defensive. Nobles back on the Home Isles are instead urging us to prepare our Veteran Longbowmen who earned their expertise in Agincourt to go on the offensive against the French. A third clique of loyal French Dukes have instead pointed to the fact that much of the French armies come from the Appanages Levies, ruled by rebellious Dukes. By bribing these Dukes we can make sure that much of the French army will refuse to fight on the side of the French King."
