 bm_the_amber_trade:0 "The Amber Trade"
 bm_the_amber_trade_desc:0 "Amber has always been an important item of exchange of the people living in the Baltic Sea coast. As early as in the antiquity, Amber was valuable and sought after beyond the Baltic Sea, especially in the Roman Empire, where it was used for decorating amphitheaters and jewellery. Ever since the Teutonic and Livonian orders gained control of the Eastern Baltic, the Orders have become rich through Amber Monopoly. Now, however, as gold, silver and other various gems become more refined, made into precious jewels and church decorations, the value of the Amber has been steadily declining for 200 years. After more than 5 millennia, the fossilised tree resin that has been appreciated for its colour and natural beauty has faded into insignificance."

 bm_toledo_steel:0 "Toledo Steel"
 bm_toledo_steel_desc:0 "Toledo has since ancient Hispania been famous for its forging, production and uniqueness of swords. Around the 15th and 16th century, Toledo became the centre of high-quality smithmaking and swordsmanship in Europe, the Greater Middle East, and after the re-conquista, the greatest in the world. And while Toledo steel set the standard for excellence in quality of European swords, there were also very few locales that surpassed Toledo in terms of production volume. As armies began to replace swords with firearms, the blacksmithing tradition at large began its decline. In an attempt to preserve the techniques, methods and quality of the Toledo Steel production, the Spanish King Carlo III ordered the creation of the Royal Sword Factory in Toledo, further continuing the value of Toledo Steel."

The City reached its golden age during the 13th centry, at that point, the city was home to over one hundred dye workers and thousands of artisan embroidery studios located in the city's medina, city centres and old-town markets."

The technique of our bronze-making is in fact so advanced that none of our neighbours are able to replicate it. Even if a foreign power more advanced than us, were to conquer us, burning down our city and stripping our royal palace of our bronze sculptures, they will be perplexed hundreds of years later over our masterful skills in bronze-making."

 bm_djerban_jewish_community_desc:0 "The island of Jerba, or Jarbah depending on pronounciation, is the largest island in North Africa, located off the coast of Tunis. Despite North Africa being a Muslim dominated region, the island of Djerba has housed for at least a millenium a large Jewish population. Historical conflicts between the Djerban Jews and Muslims have been largely absent due to the fact that all Djerbans were at some point Jewish and either converted to Islam or stayed Jewish, therefore many share a similar tradition, culture and practice in life. This community of Jews increased in size during the re-conquista and the subsequent expelling of Jews in Iberia and from Sicily."
