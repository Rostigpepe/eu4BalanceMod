 SD.1.t: "People flee [Root.GetName]"
 SD.1.desc: "The people of [Root.GetName] have been suffering from the devastation in their province, their fields are barren and houses are burned. The situation has gotten so bad that many are fleeing the area in search of a new home elsewhere. If we act fast we can put a stop to the emigration wave or at least direct it somewhere useful to us. Settling the refugees outside of their homeland might be benificial to us but will cost us a significant amount of money. In the end letting the people go where they wish might be our only option."
