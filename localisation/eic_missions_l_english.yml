eic_unequal_treaty_desc: "The government of China has long tried to keep us out.

eic_straits_settlements_title: "The Straits Settlements"
eic_straits_settlements_desc: "The straits of Malacca are a strategic position guarding the rich trade routes between China and India. Acquiring bases along this coastline with which to guide this trade and protect against hostile piracy would great increase the Company's dominance in the region."

eic_bombay_title: "Acquire Bombay"

eic_company_tolerance_desc: "We are merchants, not true statesmen - and as a result, we do not seek to propogate our culture and religion across these lands.
