 chattel_slavery_allowed: "Chattel Slavery Legal"
 desc_chattel_slavery_allowed: "Societies that practice chattel slavery treated slaves as property with no more rights than livestock. The term, chattel, means cattle, representing how these slaves had no more rights than cows. Compared to other forms of slavery, slave status was inheritable, life-long, and familes could be torn apart for a profit. In the Americas, chattel slavery was exclusively racially based, with slaves being persons that were African-born, African descent, or Native American. This created a strict caste system seperating the continent into three groups, the slave owners, the slaves, and the non-property owning freedmen."
 
 extend_slave_trade_ban_colonies: "Ban the Atlantic Slave Trade in Autonomous Colonies"
 desc_extend_slave_trade_ban_colonies: "Despite us ending our involvement in the Atlantic Slave Trade, we did not extend that ban to our autonomous colonines in the Americas. Many anti-slavery advocates are saying that a ban on the slave trade is meaningless if we do not apply it to our colonies. However, we have limited means to enforce such a ban and will rely heavily on our subject naations. If they don't cooperate, while we can still stop and detain their ships, the ban will strain relations between us and our colonies."

 desc_atlantic_slave_trade_buyer:0 "Between the 1500’s to the late 1800’s, Europeans bought and forcibly transported millions of African slaves to the New World plantations in exchange for guns, textiles, and other goods to African countries. This system was highly profitable for Europeans, which helped them develop the Americas and Europe. However, it was highly inhumane for the African slaves, who lost their lives and futures to working for white overlords. This inhumanity led to the system being abolished in the 1800’s across Europe from public outrage, however, this did little to help the millions of enslaved African-Americans in the Americas."
 desc_atlantic_slave_trade_smuggler:0 "Our Overlord wanted us to ban the African Slave Trade. While we cannot refuse this demand on paper, we decided to refuse to cooperate with Overlord and instead continue our role in the African Slave Trade illegally. While supporting smuggling is not as profitable as before, it still allows for our economic system to survive."
 desc_atlantic_slave_trade_seller:0 "The slave trade is nothing new for Africa, which partipicated in the selling of slaves from spoils of war and criminal conduct atleast since the Roman times. However, when Europeans arrived in West Afirca to buy humans to work their plantation, many African leaders sought to meet this demand. Between 1500 and 1850, millions of slaves were captured by stronger African nations and sold to the Europeans in the West African Coast. Unfortunately, this created a difficult choice for African nations as those that chose not to partipicate in the slave trade found themselves economically isolated from the rest of Africa."

A search party on the government's dime was sent around the area to find the ship, but they were unable to do so. Their attempts to find the ship were hindered by strange native attacks from the island. Apparently, some of the natives on the island looked more African than native, but attempts to investigate failed as the natives organized against them. Attempts to colonize this island in the future will be more difficult and contested than the other ones."

At this point, we cannot stop the ban so we are forced to make a decision, cooperate or don't cooperate?"
