 social_conservatism_desc:0 "The outbreak of Revolution has caused a shockwave in the political landscape. A counter-wave of so-called Social Conservatism is sweeping the continent. Many political theorists and writers are critical and even apalled by the revolutionaries destroying time-tested institutions without any assurances that they can replace them with anything better. In this emerging modern world, new ideas are not so easily accepted."
