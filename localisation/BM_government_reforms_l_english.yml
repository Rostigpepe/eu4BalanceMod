 reformed_legal_system_prussia:0 "Reformed Legal System"
 reformed_legal_system_prussia_desc:0 "As our Kaiserreich has expanded, and aged, the extent and complexity of overlapping, and often inconsistent, legal practices has grown out of control. Legal cases are decided by local, often privately employed, judges that act according to rules that differ so much from case to case that it is impossible for the state to guarantee any form of legal certainty. Some courts are rendered impotent by the maze of local, feudal, state, and imperial jurisdiciton, and others make a fortune by corrupting the authority of our laws. It is time we put our great number of legal minds and scholars to use. A new, uniform, consistent, and well-regulated legal system will be put in place for our state."
