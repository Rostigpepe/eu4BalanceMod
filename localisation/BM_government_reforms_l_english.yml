 empowering_the_junker_class_prussia_desc:0 "Let us empower the Junker Class to support our reign. This class of lower nobility is strong enough to form a powerful base against the magnates, burghers, and clergy. From this we can dominate our enemies, both foreign and domestic."

 kreditwerk_prussia:0 "The Kreditwerk"
 kreditwerk_prussia_desc:0 "The margraves of Brandenburg, and later Prussia, had historically been tasked with financing the monarch with tax income. But in the 16th-century, many of these margraves had become financially careless, highly indepted, and insolvent. To avoid this insolvency of spreading and affecting the states' income, the Kreditwerk were established. This institution was administratively independent from the elector and the Großer Ausschuß ('Great Committee') of the estates, and was tasked with strictly regulating the margrave's liabilities, private income, as well as their financial contributions to the state."

 reformed_legal_system_prussia:0 "Reformed Legal System"
 reformed_legal_system_prussia_desc:0 "As our Kaiserreich has expanded, and aged, the extent and complexity of overlapping, and often inconsistent, legal practices has grown out of control. Legal cases are decided by local, often privately employed, judges that act according to rules that differ so much from case to case that it is impossible for the state to guarantee any form of legal certainty. Some courts are rendered impotent by the maze of local, feudal, state, and imperial jurisdiciton, and others make a fortune by corrupting the authority of our laws. It is time we put our great number of legal minds and scholars to use. A new, uniform, consistent, and well-regulated legal system will be put in place for our state."

 frederick_wilhelm_reforms_prussia:0 "Frederick Wilhelm's Reforms"
 frederick_wilhelm_reforms_prussia_desc:0 "Frederick the Great reorganized the Prussian Economy by establishing additional protections for religious minorities, a national bank, tax reforms, and industrial investments. As a direct result from these policies and reforms, many religious immigrants, fleeing from persecution and war, came into Prussia. These immigrants formed large communities and settled in the less developed parts of the nation, helping boost the industrial output and contributing to the urbanisation that started forming around this time."
