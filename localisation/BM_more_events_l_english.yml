 FEE_Ansbach_Events.1.T: "The Ambition of Achilles"
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.1.D: "While the Duchy of Franconia has long fallen into disuse, our family still holds significant lands in the area. The Margraviates of Ansbach and Bayreuth have long since enjoyed independence, away from our crown's influence. In order to secure our vested interests in the area and protect its people from foreign invasions, we should secure and press our legitimate claims on the surrounding areas by any means necessary, starting with the city of Nuremberg. Such an act will certainly be viewed as hostile and therefore we should be vigilant when it comes to approaching this delicate matter."

 FEE_Ansbach_Events.2.D: "Of the many titles once held by our ancestors, one resides in the city of Nuremberg, A prosperous urban center filled with all manner of merchants, noblemen and artisans. This newfound prosperity propelled Nuremberg to a new height of success and profitability. Due to their influence as a centre of Germany, Emperor $EMPERORNAME$ saw fit to award them the title of "Free City", placing its walls and citizens under the Empire's protection. Despite these hurdles however, we must decide on whether we will press our claim on the city despite having our previous attempts rebuked, or abandon our plans altogether and maintain the status quo."

 FEE_Ansbach_Events.6.OPT2: "The city is ours anyway."

 FEE_Ansbach_Events.7.T: "Failed Negotiations"

 FEE_Ansbach_Events.10.D: "With Nuremberger support, the Hohenzollerns hold great economic and military influence over the rest of the Franconian Circle, and yet we are denied a right we are entitled to; the right to sit at the head of this union. This disgraceful offense against the Hohenzollerns cannot be tolerated!"
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.10.OPT1: "Demand Wurzburg hand over the ducal title and seat"
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.10.OPT2: "Or can it?"

 FEE_Ansbach_Events.11.T: "The Ducal Title"
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.11.D: "The Hohenzollerns of Ansbach have demanded our royal title and leading position in the Franconian Circle. Their illegitimate claims that they should lead this military alliance solely derives from power and influence. Though it is tempting to completely disregard their outlandish ultimatum, we must take into account their military and economic might."
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.11.OPT1: "It is in our best interests to just submit."
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.11.OPT2: "We will never submit to their insolence!"

 FEE_Ansbach_Events.12.T: "Demands Refused!"
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.12.D: "The Bishop of Wurzburg has rejected our humble request for the role of head of the Franconian Circle, and has insulted in reprisal. Bearing an insult alone is plenty, but the shame of serving a tyrannical bishop is a burden too large to endure. Summon the banner, rally the men, and invite the captains; it is time to seize what is rightfully ours!"
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.12.OPT1: "They shall suffer and beg for forgiveness."
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.12.OPT2: "Sooner or later they will regret their actions. For now, it is best to wait."

 FEE_Ansbach_Events.14.D: "The city of Coburg was a Franconian fief that was under Brandenburgian suzerainty from 1291 - 1312, but was inherited and later integrated by the von Wettin dynasty in 1372. Thanks to a marriage to a Hohenzollern princess in 1374, our blood has flowed in the veins of the von Wettin dynasty of Thuringia for generations. Although these claims may be farfetched, they are adequate enough for us to press them by force!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.1.T: "The Assassination of Pedro de Arbués"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.1.D: "Having seen many religious practices spread across the peninsula since the time of the Romans, Iberia was traditionally a place of tolerance and coexistence. However, in 1478 Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon received permission from the Pope to establish the national Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition to replace the papal Inquisition of the middle ages.\n\nOne of the first officers of the Spanish Inquisition was Pedro de Arbués, who relentlessly pursued heretics and \"conversos\", Jews who had received baptism, but who were often suspected of still practicing Judaism. In 1484, his efforts earned him the position as the Inquisitor Provincial of the Kingdom of Aragon.\nIn Aragon, the Inquisition immediately became unpopular, as it was seen as an attack on the provinces' autonomy. Combined with Arbués' pursuit of influential converso families, he quickly attracted notoriety, and on the 14th of September 1485, he was attacked while attending mass.\nThe presence of conversos among the assailants sparked a movement against Jews, which saw more than twenty executions."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.1.OPT1: "Arbués was a true man of faith!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.1.OPT2: "The Inquisition has gone too far already."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.2.T: "The War in Ribagorza"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.2.D: "Following brewing tensions in the county of Ribagorza, the peasants have now risen against their count. They claim that the Count Ribagorza is not their legitimate ruler, and that they should be ruled directly by the Crown. While this is most flattering for our ruler, agreeing to the peasants' demands would greatly upset the nobles of the region."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.2.OPT1: "These peasants are loyal servants of the Crown."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.2.OPT2: "The feudal order must be upheld!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.3.T: "Alteraciones de Aragón"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.3.D: "In 1578 Antonio Pérez, long the trusted advisor of King Philip, had his political enemy Juan de Escobedo stabbed to death in a back alley in Madrid, following several clumsy attempts at poisoning him. Although the king originally approved of the plan, he started to question Pérez's motives, and in 1579 arrested him. Many years would pass before Pérez managed to escape to Aragon.\nThere he made himself subject to the regional laws, the fueros, before going on trial before the justice of Aragon. As the court sided with Pérez, the king withdrew his accusation, but presented a new one through his official representative in Aragon. This time Pérez was sentenced to death, but ensured his safety by appealing to the notion that the king was overstepping his bounds and not respecting Aragon's sovereignty.\nAfter the legal process continued to drag on, the king tried to bypass the justice of Aragon by accusing Antonio Pérez of heresy through the Inquisition. As bypassing Aragonese law and custom was exactly what had angered the Aragonese enough to keep Pérez alive, they rose up in revolt. A fed up King Philip invaded Aragon - formally his own domain - with Castilian troops, and put the chief justice to death without trial as a statement of authority.\n\nAntonio Pérez had already escaped to France and later England, and would die of natural causes in 1611."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.3.OPT1: "Pérez will be punished, no matter the Aragonese!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.6.T: "The Miracle of Calanda"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.6.D: "A miracle! The Blessed Virgin Mary has healed a man! Miguel Pellicer had his leg amputated two and a half years ago, and unable to work the fields he took to begging, but every night he would ask the priests at the Sanctuary of the Pillar for some oil to rub his leg, believing this to be a way to call upon the favor of the virgin. It must have worked, for this past Easter, Pellicer woke up one day with both his legs!\nNow, following a lengthy inquiry by priests and doctors, the archbishop of Zaragoza has pronounced it a true miracle! As word is spreading, the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar becomes even more famous and prestigious by the day!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.6.OPT1: "May the Madonna bless us all!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.7.T: "Constructing the Canal Imperial de Aragón"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.7.D: "For centuries, travel and trade through the Aragonese inland has relied on the river Ebro. Its waters are unpredictable in the Iberian heat however, so our royal engineers have designed a canal, using techniques imported from elsewhere in Europe to bind our country closer together.\nUnder the direction of the cleric Ramón Pignatelly, they are ready to begin their great project."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.7.OPT1: "It is a worthy project, and just what Aragon needs!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.7.OPT2: "Let's employ the people in bettering the old waterways instead."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.8.T: "The Canal Imperial de Aragón Stands Complete"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.8.D: "After years of work, the canal has finally opened for boat travel. Already shipments are brought between Zaragoza and Navarra in far greater quantities than before. This lets us export Zaragozan wares across the Atlantic and to Northern Europe, and Navarran goods to the Mediterranean. Our nation is sure to prosper from this revolutionary waterway!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.8.OPT1: "At last. Time to roll in the trade money!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.9.T: "The Ciudadela de Jaca"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.9.D: "The many wars with the enemies to the north has proven time and again that Jaca is of utter strategic importance.\n\nWatching over one of the few crossroads of the Pyrenees, it is key to the defense of the kingdom. We should build a citadel to exert our power."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.9.OPT1: "The garrison there will be enough."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.9.OPT2: "Hire the best engineer that can be found."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.10.T: "A Foreign Viceroy"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.10.D: "As Aragon and Castile were to be equals under the Spanish crown, but the King of the two countries hailed from Castile, the ancient laws and practices of Aragon had a special protected status. These stated that if the country should be ruled by a viceroy appointed by a foreign king, he must be Aragonese.\n\nAs this practice safeguards the people of Aragon from foreign influence, it contributed to the stability of the union. However, it would not be long before the foreign king appointed a viceroy from his own inner circle, rather than listen to the nobles of Aragon."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.10.OPT1: "Let our overlord appoint whoever they wish."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.10.OPT2: "Ensure an Aragonese viceroy."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.11.T: "Jeronimo Zurita"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.11.D: "Jeronimo de Zurita y Castro was a an Aragonese historian born in 1512. Born in Zaragoza, he studied in Castile and under Hellenist teachers, developed his ideas of history. Eventually he would become the official chronicler of the Kingdom of Aragon in 1548. He defined a new historic practice, where the Archives of Aragon alone were not enough, but sources from Rome, Naples and Sicily had to be referenced and compared to create a fuller historical picture of events. Eventually he resigned to dedicate himself to the \"Anales de la Corona de Aragon,\" which would stand the test of time as a central authority on the history of Spain."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.11.OPT1: "Employ him."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.11.OPT2: "Support him in defining our history."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.12.T: "Miguel Servet"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.12.D: "Miguel Servet was a Spanish renaissance polymath, both a very noteable physician and theologian. He also made advancements in mathematics, astronomy and geography, along with writing poetry and interpreting the Bible. He was a perfect Renaissance man, any king's dream citizen, except for that last one.\nAs the Protestant Reformation spread across Europe, Servet challenged his own faith and found new truths in the Bible. However, he found both Lutheranism lacking, and even clashed directly with Calvin over his ideas of predestination. In the end, the letters he sent to Calvin proved fatal, as the reformer sent them to Catholic authorities to oust Servet as a heretic. Escaping from France to Italy, Servet stopped in Geneva to hear his opponent preach. Servet was arrested by the reformists however, and in an attempt to prove the orthodoxy of his movement, Calvin pushed to have him executed before Servet's Catholic pursuers could catch up to him.\n\nWithout this unfortunate end, Miguel Servet might have been the source of a reform movement of his own."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.12.OPT1: "Who cares about his beliefs, the man is a genius!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.12.OPT2: "Hunt him down!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.13.T: "Michael Servetus tried in $PROVINCE$"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.13.D: "Michael Servetus was a Spanish physician and scholar, an archetypical Renaissance man. However, his interpretation of the bible brought him into conflict with not just the catholics of Spain and France, but also the established reform movements of Lutheranism and Calvinism.\n\nNow, while on the run from Catholic authorities, he passed through $PROVINCE$, in the hopes of seeing one of our great reformers speak. However, his heretical views on predestination have led to him being arrested by them too, and now he is set to be executed for his beliefs."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.13.OPT1: "This man is a danger to every Christian!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.13.OPT2: "Intervene. He seems to have some interesting ideas."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.14.T: "Baltasar Gracián"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.14.D: "Baltasar Gracián was a Spanish writer and philosopher in the first half of the 17th century. He became a Jesuit and an army chaplain, but a lot of his practices were frowned upon by his superiors. However, he continued in reading letters sent from Hell as a form of preaching and publishing unapproved books, the most famous of which is the masterpiece of Spanish literature known as \"El Criticon\". Despite continuing to have trouble with his religious order, he became the defining voice of Baroque literature in Spain, and the main representative of the literary tradition of Conceptism."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.14.OPT1: "His wit and thoughtfulness will be popular at court."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.14.OPT2: "Let him write. His religious order can deal with him."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.15.T: "The Siege of Zaragoza"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.15.D: "It should have been such a quick battle. An open city against the overwhelming armies of the enemy. But the people in Zaragoza are fervent supporters of their $MONARCHTITLE$ and ready to die for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. The Marshal commanding the enemy has himself admitted: \"What a war! What men!

 FEE_Aragon_Events.16.T: "The Channel Construction Requires More Funds"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.16.D: "The work on the Imperial Channel is slow and constantly requires more funds and time. The Count of Aranda, president of the Royal Council, has arranged the project to be financed by the government despite its high cost. However, if the project is to continue, the rest of the Royal Council will have to be convinced."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.16.OPT1: "Make the council support the project."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.16.OPT2: "Is this spending really wise?"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.17.T: "Responsibility for the Construction Project"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.17.D: "The Count of Aranda has entrusted the new channel project to the clergy, especially the bishop Ramón Pignatelli. His mind is swift and he seems to embrace new Enlightenment ideas. He advocates for new financial institutions for the poor, cultural patronage of the arts, and for reforming both education and the economy."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.17.OPT1: "This is the man to lead the construction of the channel!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.17.OPT2: "Maybe we should pick someone less... passionate."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.18.T: "Pignatelli Upsets Colleagues"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.18.D: "Pignatelli has upset his colleagues with his new ideas. In order to get more funds, he granted exemptions from Church taxes next to the new channel. People have gathered with the promise of irrigated soil and a better future, but a decision must be made between progress and respect for the Church."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.18.OPT1: "We trust Pignatelli."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.18.OPT2: "The Holy Church must be respected!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.19.T: "Channel Construction Faces Engineering Trouble"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.19.D: "The terrain is difficult in the proximity to the city of Zaragoza. There are big differences in height and the engineers are afraid cost can increase. However, some of them are hopeful this can bring more prosperity to the land, allowing more mills and fullings."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.19.OPT1: "We should listen to the engineers."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.19.OPT2: "Let's take a simple approach."

 FEE_Austria_Events.1.T: "The Reforms of the 1495 Diet of Worms"
 FEE_Austria_Events.1.D: "The reforms presented at the Diet of Worms in 1495 was the Emperor Maximilian I's attempt at centralising the Holy Roman Empire. The most lasting of these reforms was the establishment of the Reichskammergericht, which would function as the Empire's highest court, along with an imperial ban on internal feuding, the Ewiger Landfriede.\n\nMaximilian also established an Imperial government, the \"The Reichsregiment,\" which was separate from the emperor's court. This was intended to efficiently administrate the Empire as a whole, even outside of the Imperial Diet. It would represent every princedom in the Empire, but never fully managed to assume its position of power, and was dissolved in 1502."

 FEE_Austria_Events.3.T: "The Austrian Baroque"
 FEE_Austria_Events.3.D: "While devastated by the long wars of the early 17th century, the Imperial Austria proved resilient, and the peace that followed became a time of great artistic patronage.\nWhether painting, sculpture or architecture, the Habsburgs were among the foremost patrons in the world. Over the course of a century, the already grand imperial capital of Vienna was expanded and developed, resulting in the largest baroque palaces in the world towering over peasants and kings alike. While the emperor's strict yoke went against the political development of the era, Austrian art flourished."

 FEE_Austria_Events.9.T: "Vienna captured by Matthias Corvinus"
 FEE_Austria_Events.9.D: "Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, was the nemesis of Emperor Friedrich V. They both claimed the Hungarian and Bohemian throne, they mistrusted each other, they both were eager to dominate southeastern Europe - thus saw each other as their greatest obstacle - and they were contrary characters, Friedrich patient, contemplative, fatalistic and sometimes phlegmatic, Matthias determined, ambitious and aggressive. Thus the peace concluded between Poland, Bohemia and Hungary in 1477 did not include Friedrich. The rivalry between the two, before sparked by Friedrich suspecting Matthias of secretly allowing the Ottomans to invade Austria through Hungary and supporting Wladislas Jagiello as King of Bohemia against the claims of Matthias, deteriorated into a personal feud. On the battlefield, Matthias Corvinus got the upper hand, swiftly defeated Friedrich even after he had gathered an Imperial army and invaded his hereditary lands. Within 5 years, Matthias' army reduced Frederick's strongholds one by one. The Emperor was deeply humiliated and his defeat evident in 1485 when Hungarian armies captured Vienna and he had to flee to Linz. In the last years of his life he was deeply depressive due to this shame. Vienna was only recaptured by his son Maximilian."

 FEE_Austria_Events.10.D: "Having been offered the throne by some malcontent nobles, in 1459 Friedrich III was crowned King of Hungary with the crown of St. Stephen that had been in his possession since 1440. When Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, had managed to crush the rebellious nobles and secure his diplomatic positions by reaching agreements with Jiri Podiebrad of Bohemia and the mercenary Jan Vitovec who had seized the former Cilli estates and he was about to threaten Austria, Friedrich quickly accepted a treaty in which we abandonned his claim on Hungary, but kept the title of King of Hungary, retained several border districts including the towns of Guns and Eisenstadt, was ceded the city of Sopron, received a ransom of 60000 ducats for the crown of St. Stephen and was appointed heir of Matthias in case of a childless death."

 FEE_Berbers_Events.1.T: "Barbary Pirates Seek Privateer Contracts"
 FEE_Berbers_Events.1.D: "Piracy in the Mediterranean and the capture of Christian slaves has been increasing for a long time, in no small thanks due to sponsorship from the Ottoman Sultanate. Over the course of the 16th and 17th century, so-called \"Barbary Corsairs\" were one of the greatest threats to Christian ships in the Mediterranean, and their dreadful raids prevented most settlement along the coast of Spain and Southern Italy. \n\nDistant naval expeditions are challenging however, and impossible without a port to call home. We have been approached by a group of pirates who wish to enter into a privateer contract with us, and use one of our ports as their base of operations.\nIn addition to harassing the coastal settlements of the infidels of Europe, they promise they will be bringing a wealth of taken goods and slaves through our lands."
 FEE_Berbers_Events.1.OPT1: "Of course our ports are open to them!"
 FEE_Berbers_Events.1.OPT2: "It is better to trade with the Christians than rob them."

 FEE_Berbers_Events.2.T: "Sponsor Barbary Raid"
 FEE_Berbers_Events.2.D: "The Barbary Corsairs operating out of our ports are planning a major expedition against a coastal town in Europe. Their preparations seem to be more for a military expedition than a piratical raid, but they swear they will be bringing back as much loot and as many slaves as their ships can bear.\nOf course, their captain assures us, they could bring much more if the king were to assist with a few more ships..."

 FEE_Berbers_Events.4.D: "They came early in the morning with the northern wind, to pillage and enslave, but we had warning. A fisherman had spotted their ships off the coast a few days before, and troops were sent to every town nearby. Once the Barbary Corsairs landed, our brave soldiers engaged the infidels in fierce battle. They hadn't expected such resistance, and soon fell back to their ships. Our troops managed to set fire to one of their vessels, but the rest fled back to the North African emirate whose flags they flew.\nThey might return one day, but for now $PROVINCE$ is safe."

However, towards the end of the 17th European ships started being equipped with more advanced weaponry, making raiding ships challenging, and ensuring greater safety on most trade routes used by the Christians.

Vladislav indeed succeeded him and initiated a half-century of Jagiellon rule in Bohemia which proved to be backwards, intolerant in religious matters, devastating for Bohemia's economy and eventually resulted in the disaster of 1526.

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.D: "In the last years of his reign, Matthias Corvinus tried to ensure the succession of his highly gifted, but illegitimate son Janos, made him the largest landholder in Hungary after the King by several grants of territory, put him in charge of several of the strongest and most important fortresses, gave him the holy crown of St. Stephen and got a majority of the royal council to support Janos. However Matthias Corvinus died of a stroke before the matter was definitely secured, and the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Matthias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471. Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490 and immediately thereafter accepted the compact of Farkashida in which he confirmed all existing privileges of the nobility and took back all legal and administrative reforms, including the efficient system of taxation regarded as repressive by the magnates. After 3 decades of prosperity and modernisation, the election of Vladislav initiated a rapid decline, ending up in the disaster of Mohacs. Another candidate to the throne was Maximilian of Habsburg who maintained the claim of his father Friedrich III, but since he had already proven to be a capable ruler and would have been likely to use his powerbase in the Empire, Austria and Burgundy to consolidate his authority in Hungary, he was no popular choice. Had Janos Corvinus indeed managed to become King, he might have continued the achievements of his father but would have been violently opposed by the powerful magnates."

Many of the most talented and educated Bohemians flocked to the Hussite cause, and their ingenuity allowed them to craft new weapons and fight against overwhelming odds.\n\nIn fact, many of the new weapons and tactics used would later grow to define early modern European warfare. The infamous Hussite wagon fort would be adopted by German, Hungarian, Russian, and even British armies.

Additionally, he dreamed of uniting Christian nations against the rising threat of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOne proponent of Podebrad's plan was a prominent nobleman who proved himself an able diplomat, representing Bohemia in the courts of Austria and Hungary. His work, while unsuccessful in establishing Podebrad's dream, did go a long way towards smoothing over the rift between Bohemia and her neighbors. \n\nPodebrad's Hussite beliefs prevented his ideas from being seriously considered, especially as the Pope, whose power was threatened by this Union, worked against him. However, his message of peace planted a seed in European politics that would never be wholly forgotten."

This would go on to become the first truly standardized coinage across the Holy Roman Empire, and would become the ancestor of the British silver crown, the Dutch rijksdaalder, and even the US dollar.\n\nThis large, reliable coin filled the void as a reliable standard of exchange between the regions of Europe, especially in the prosperous but divided principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, where the coin received Imperial approval."

One of the expressions of this wealth were the enormous and extravagant feasts hosted by the Dukes. Rich wines, exotic meats, spectacular troubadour and jongleur performances, fancy desserts, and beautiful wares all enchanted guests from all over Christendom, and this in turn made Burgundian luxury items in more demand. Burgundian styles became the most prominent in Europe in the 15th century, even surpassing the dazzling Venetians.

 FEE_Denmark_Events.1.T: "The Stockholm Bloodbath"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.1.D: "The union of Sweden under Denmark was an unstable one, and only a strong Danish ruler could keep Sweden under their thumb. In 1520, King Christian went as far as to lead a military intervention in Sweden. Successful in his endeavour, Christian was anointed and swore the traditional oath to only appoint natural-born Swedes to the governing of the country. A great banquet was held in Stockholm in his honor, lasting several days. Then, on the 7th of November, the massacre began.\nThe king summoned many prominent Swedish officials and politicians to a private conference in the castle. Once there they were well received, but the king's hospitality only went so far. Soon Danish soldiers arrived with torches and axes and took them capture. Over the following day, more than 80 nobles, clergymen and politicians would be executed under the pretense of heresy. \n\nWhile intended to bring Sweden to its knees before Denmark, the executions had the opposite effect, and was the event that sparked the Swedish War of Liberation that permanently ended the union."

Then on the 8th of November, he called the most prominent nobles, clergymen and politicians to the palace. They were called inside for a private conference. Then the massacre began. More than 80 men were executed on false charges of heresy over the course of a few days; the headsman's axe never stopped swinging.\nWe have lost many of our greatest, but we are still, and will forever remain a country of our own.

 FEE_Denmark_Events.3.D: "Born in 1494, Tausen became a priest on the eve of the Protestant Reformation. He went to Wittenberg in 1523, and was convinced by Lutheran principles. Upon his return to Denmark he started preaching the Lutheran faith, and he found many listening ears. He left the official church and made a practice of preaching from the church tower in Viborg. When he was denied the right to preach in the church, his followers broke in and forced a compromise where catholic priests would preach in the morning, and Tausen in the afternoon. The bishop has found this unacceptable, so he sent armed men to imprison the rogue priest. That hasn't helped, however, as large crowds now gather outside the window of his cell to hear him preach! \n\nIn time Hans Tausen would go on to become the foremost theologian of the Danish Reformation, but for now we must decide what to do with this heretic!"

 FEE_Denmark_Events.4.D: "Hans Tausen was a priest convinced by Lutheran ideas, who had become noticed for preaching in the church of Viborg before the country's official conversion. He was imprisoned, but King Frederick I saw an opportunity. Interested in Lutheran ideas himself, particularly the ones about rulers receiving the church's property, he placed Tausen under his protection and named him court chaplain. As the Danish Reformation continued to spread, Tausen was called to preach in Copenhagen. The protestants became more and more confrontational against the catholic priests, and once King Fredrik died and Tausen was tried for heresy, a mob rose to attack the bishop of Copenhagen, ensuring Tausen's safety, who in turn protected the bishop from murder by mob.\nOnce Denmark officially converted to Protestantism, Tausen was appointed bishop of Ribe. During his twenty years in that position, he continued to direct much of the still developing protestant faith in Denmark."

This removed the traditional pretense of election in the Danish succession, but more importantly it allowed the king to abolish the \"Rigsraad,\" the group of nobles responsible for co-governing Denmark.

 FEE_Denmark_Events.12.D: "Johann Friedrich Struensee became the court doctor of the mentally ill King Christian VII. While initially disliked at court, he rose in power and used his influence to become the de facto regent of Denmark in 1771, when the king became too ill to govern at all. \nWhile in power, he attempted to institute extensive liberal reforms, issuing more than three cabinet orders a day. While his reforms were initially well-received, they soon became unpopular as they seemed to go against Danish values and traditions for the sake of abstract concepts of liberty.

He doesn't seem to mind if the king and the nobles end up living in the smallest mansions in the country! \nIn addition, he has made bribes illegal, which means that a poor near-destitute noble cannot even spend the last slivers of his fortune on a lucrative court position with lots of taxation rights! It's all a travesty, does he mean to run everyone into the gutters?"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.18.OPT1: "I guess nobility can't be bought, then."

 FEE_Denmark_Events.19.T: "Struensee Reorganizes the Army"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.19.D: "Oh dread! Struensee has settled on a model for reorganising the army, and the policy can be summed up as \"spend less money on it.\"\nThis is any truly great nation's nightmare."
 FEE_Denmark_Events.19.OPT1: "But I like wars!"

 FEE_Denmark_Events.20.T: "Struensee Reforms Universities and Hospitals"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.20.D: "Johann Friedrich Struensee has turned his attention to the reform of public universities and made them open to... well, the public. No longer shall your background be relevant for whether you are able to receive a university education, as long as you have the intelligence to pass the entrance exams and the funds to pay for it. Similarly, state-run hospitals are now supposed to offer equal service to every person who comes to them in need. A subsidy program will also help the poor receive advanced treatment, despite the fact that healing the poor is strictly God's job."
 FEE_Denmark_Events.20.OPT1: "Public education and medicine? What's next, FREE public education and medicine?"

 FEE_Denmark_Events.21.T: "Struensee and the Queen"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.21.D: "In addition to his wild and sweeping reforms, Struensee got wild and sweeping with Queen Caroline Matilda. While she initially disdained him when he first came to court, she grew to appreciate him, and even love him. Their affair while the king was incapacitated was no secret, but Caroline Matilda was never bothered by scandal, as she was used to wearing men's clothing in public and meddling in state affairs. Eventually she even bore Struensee as a child, even though Princess Louise Auguste was recognised as a child of the king."
 FEE_Denmark_Events.21.OPT1: "Scandalous!"

 FEE_Denmark_Events.22.T: "Struensee Establishes Freedom of the Press"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.22.D: "Struensee has now removed every censorship law in the country, allowing anyone to print whatever they want. While announced as a noble deed, we can rest relieved knowing that the pamphlets in greatest circulation are the anti-Struensee ones."
 FEE_Denmark_Events.22.OPT1: "Bet he didn't see that coming."

 FEE_Denmark_Events.23.T: "Plot Against Struensee"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.23.D: "Following his sweeping reforms, Struensee has attracted the enmity of many, noble and non-noble rich person alike! However, following his scandals and his unstoppable reform desire, even the commoners are starting to think he might be going too far, abandoning Danish ideals in favor of abstract German ideas.\nWith Struensee's support fraying, a conspiracy formed, and it has now imprisoned Struensee, and aims to undo all his work. This might be for the best, as the doctor would need a miracle or royal interference to save his life now."
 FEE_Denmark_Events.23.OPT1: "About time we cut his head off, this was getting out of hand!"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.23.OPT2: "That's enough! The people will free Struensee and abolish the entire monarchy!"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.23.OPT3: "The Queen will capitalise on his reforms to seize power."

 FEE_Denmark_Events.24.T: "The Riksråd of Denmark"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.24.D: "Throughout the Middle Ages, Danish earls and other nobles sought to limit the power of the Kings of Denmark, who had been a very strong and sometimes outright tyrannical ruler during the early days of the Danish Kingdom. \nThe Riksråd, or Council of the Realm, was first mentioned in the 1320s. By the 1440s it had become known as main opponent of royal power. In general, they maintained a healthy balance of power, electing the kings of Denmark in exchange for giving certain lucrative revenues to the King. The nobles in turn generally protected the rights of the common people from excessive taxation, and took on much of the administration of the realm.\nWith the loss of the Kingdom of Sweden, however, came a break in the balance of power. The heavy losses suffered by royal armies and treasury as well as the loss of prestige gave them the opportunity to seize more power for themselves. They now demand that the King sign a haandfæstning, a document guaranteeing noble privileges as a condition of the nobility's acceptance of the King's continued rule. Among the new rights\nthey demand is the right to revolt against any King that does not keep all promises, written or spoken, to the noble estate. Failure to sign this document, they warn, will force the nobility to invoke Denmark's ancient elective monarchy, in which the de facto recognition of hereditary rule will be abolished and a new King sought from elsewhere…"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.24.OPT1: "Attempt to Compromise with the Nobility"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.24.OPT2: "These demands are preposterous!"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.24.OPT3: "Give them what they want"

 FEE_Denmark_Events.25.T: "The Riksråd of Norway"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.25.D: "While the nobles have been more influential in Denmark, Norway's status as a junior partner has robbed their nobility of much of their power to restrain the king. Furthermore, Norway's status as a true hereditary monarchy, rather than Denmark's de jure elective monarchy, meant that the powers of the Norwegian Riksråd diminished over time rather than strengthened. Soon they served as little more than councils in the case of regency. \nIn 1536, King Christian III of Denmark-Norway, in response to a bishop-led rebellion against his efforts to convert Norway to Lutheranism, finally abolished the Norwegian Riksråd, which never assembled again."
 FEE_Denmark_Events.25.OPT1: "Excellent"

 FEE_Denmark_Events.26.T: "Danish Intervention in the Protestant League"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.26.D: "By the 16th century, Denmark remained one of the most powerful, and crucially, most wealthy realms in Europe. In addition, it was one of the few realms outside the Holy Roman Empire to have adopted Lutheranism. As one of the leading Lutheran rulers, then, [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Denmark looked on anxiously as the clouds of religious war gathered over Germany, although he did not formally join the league. A victory for the Catholic Empire, he knew, could only spell disaster for Lutheranism in Europe and would upset the balance of Europe in a way very likely to endanger Danish sovereignty."
 FEE_Denmark_Events.26.OPT1: "It is time we intervened in this war"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.26.OPT2: "We should stay out of German affairs"

 FEE_Denmark_Events.27.T: "Economic Reforms"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.27.D: "Denmark's strategic location has brought it great wealth from North and Baltic Sea trade. However, Denmark is not a populous nation, nor one especially rich in natural resources. It's production depends chiefly on agriculture still, even as other nations rush to exploit more lucrative resources and industries. Even our agriculture risks falling behind, as nobles continue to use serfdom instead of free peasantry, lowering the quality (and therefore the prince) of our grain."
 FEE_Denmark_Events.27.OPT1: "We must make all efforts to diversify our economy!"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.27.OPT2: "We must expand our trade networks to bring in more wealth!"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.27.OPT3: "We must reform the Agricultural sector!"

 FEE_Denmark_Events.28.T: "Diversification Efforts Fail"
 FEE_Denmark_Events.28.D: "Despite the best efforts of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the vested interests in agricultural serfdom were simply too strong to overcome. Additionally, the lack of mineral resources and the dependence on imports made any heavy industry or weapons manufacturing a non-starter. It seems Denmark is doomed to continue in the old ways as the rest of the world advances…"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.1.D: "Educated first as a lawyer and then as a statesman, Sir Francis Bacon quickly rose to prominence due to a brilliant intellect and a passionate devotion for understanding and uncovering the truth in all areas.\n\nHis greatest work, the Novum Organum, was a breakthrough in the scientific understanding of the world, where Bacon laid a foundation for empiricism and outline for the first time the steps of the Scientific Method."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.1.OPT1: "An excellent minister!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.T: "The Authorized Version"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.D: "As the Reformation and printing press sweep mainland Europe in tandem, here in England the Bible has been no stranger to the English tongue. Indeed, as far back as 1382 the Bible was translated into English by John Wycliffe. In more recent times, translations from the continent have started to arrive, and the first printed English Bible was produced by William Tyndale in 1525.\n\nHowever, the Wycliffe Bible is outdated and thus difficult to read; the continental translations are too full of notes (some of which run contrary to our own beliefs!) to be useful, and Tyndale's Bible is incomplete.\n\nTo this end, $MONARCH$ has summoned a conference at a royal palace in Hampton Court, including scholars, theologians from every protestant sect in England, and even playwrights and printers. Of this motley crew, who shall be primarily entrusted with the Word of God?"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.OPT1: "Only the theologians can be trusted in this matter."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.OPT2: "Surely the eminent scholars of our land are best suited for this task."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.OPT3: "Would not God himself wish his Word be translated with beauty?"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.3.T: "The Wicked Bible"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.3.D: "The royal project to translate the Bible into English was an astounding success. Not only is it a uniform translation, but one done with such literary excellence that many scholars consider it stylistically superior to the Greek original!\n\nWhile the finished product may be magnificent, that did not, however, prevent several errors on the part of the printers. One particularly embarrassing error, quickly dubbed the Wicked Bible to riotous laughter among the populace, omitted the word “not” from one of the Ten Commandments. The result? “Thou shalt commit adultery.” Of course this defect was quickly corrected, but what shall be done with such a miscreant printer?"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.3.OPT2: "This was embarrassing, but still a simple mistake."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.4.T: "The Acts of Union"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.4.D: "With the subjugation of Scotland all but completed and with the reigning in of Ireland well underway, the Acts of Union seek to formalize this unification de jure by claiming the mantle of the ancient Roman name of Britannia. However, while England is by far the largest and most powerful of the three British crowns of England, Scotland, and Ireland, a lasting union cannot be maintained simply with England alone while ignoring the others. As the Romans did before us, the Celtic fringe of Britannia is simply too proud and tumultuous to be ignored, and perhaps unable to be controlled by military means alone.\n\nTo the end of preserving a stable union, the Acts of Union have been proposed, creating a co-equal union rather than a purely English-dominated empire, in which Scottish and Irish concerns would both be heard. Doing this would keep the individuals kingdom's commotions from destabilizing the land as a whole."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.4.OPT1: "We must have a complete and co-equal union!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.5.D: "Despite the de jure unification of the crowns of Britain, several more rambunctious elements, especially the Highland clans, still manage their own affairs with little regard for what the crown has to say. Our Scottish officials have managed to bring them willy-nilly to the table to settle their differences with us at Icolmkill but perhaps continuing this decentralized pattern would be beneficial for us in the long term?"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.7.D: "Despite the relative religious peace enjoyed by our island, in marked contrast to the religious strife on the continent, not everyone here is satisfied with our religious state of affairs. A number of more radical sects have found a receptive audience.\n\nThe most prominent of these are a sect of radical reformers who have come to be called Puritans due to their belief that our church is impure and must be radically purged and purified to be acceptable to God. Their biggest grievances with us include our toleration of Catholics and other heretics, as well as what they view as materialism and hedonism within the church.\n\nTheir influence is magnified by the fact that many of their followers come from within the emerging middle and merchant classes."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.8.D: "With wars and unrest always taxing on the national economy, a few ambitious and pragmatic bankers have approached us with a way out our current financial straits. Not only would this rid us of our national debt, they say, but would also stand to make not only us, but anyone who invests in their plan a healthy profit.\n\nTheir plan? Turn our debt into payable securities to be sold in exchange for stock in their new trading company, dubbed the South Seas Company, which would receive a crown monopoly on all trade in the “South Seas.” What exactly the South Seas are was never really defined anywhere, but the agents of the Company assure us that our share of Company stock would make us more money than we could dream of needing to pay off our debt.\n\nIt all seems rather confusing, and nothing has been specified or promised on paper. Our bankers strongly advise against this, but it could yet solve our problems."

The soaring stock prices caused a ripple effect causing rents, food, and even human hair to become astronomically expensive as everyone anticipated a quick and easy payout. That is, until some of the most prominent shareholders realized what was going on and pulled out. The resulting crash wiped out the fortunes of thousands overnight and high prices for everything that few could afford. Many have even been driven to suicide.\n\nThese scheming scoundrels have single-handedly crashed the national economy!"

The crown of England has already faded, trade, tax and production dying out, tarnished and dirty. To think that God, who we were so faithful to, has struck down so many innocents simply staggers the mind. The recent epidemic is thought to have come from diseased cotton brought by the Dutch, Amsterdam having been ravaged by the plague but a year before.

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.19.D: "The ambitions of the Holy Roman Emperor in Europe have gone unchecked for too long. In June of 1520, the two kings of England and France, Henry VIII and Francis I, met at Balinghem in the Pas-de-Calais to discuss how to deal with the rapidly growing threat of Charles V, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor. By this time the centuries-old rivalry between England and France was dying down, and both kings wished to be seen as renaissance princes, delivering peace through their own strength. The summit was termed the 'Field of the Cloth of Gold' for its opulence and grandiose nature, each king striving to outdo the other in wealth, with dazzling tents and clothes, huge feasts, music, jousting and games. The tents and the costumes displayed so much cloth of gold, an expensive fabric woven with silk and gold thread, that the site of the meeting was named after it."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.19.OPT1: "Let us extend an offer to the French of a summit."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.19.OPT2: "The French are, and always shall be our enemies!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.20.T: "The Rough Wooing"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.20.D: "In 1543, the king of Scotland had died, leaving the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. In the same year, England and Scotland agreed in the Treaty of Greenwich that Prince Edward of England should marry the young Scottish queen. However, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament. \nHenry VIII of England still desired to see the two countries united, and used the rejection of the treaty as an excuse to renew the war against Scotland, with the goal of forcing Queen Mary to wed his son. \nThe resulting conflict lasted for eight years of terrible warfare, but saw Scotland retain its independence."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.20.OPT1: "It is in our interest to unite the crowns."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.21.T: "Sake Dean Mahomed"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.21.D: "Sheikh Din Muhammad, or Sake Dean Mahomed, was born in 1759 in Bihar. His father worked for the East India Company, and upon his death, the ten year old Sake was adopted by a British Captain. He became a surgeon in the British Army, and fought in the war against the Marathas. When his foster father and closest friend resigned from the army, Mahomed accompanied him to Britain. \n\nThere he published his book, \"The Travels of Dean Mahomet\", which described several Indian cities, as well as the faded glories of the Mughal Empire. He went on to open Britain's first Indian restaurant, as well as introducing Indian soaps and the practice of \"shampoo\". This was how he went on to become the \"shampooing surgeon\" for both King George IV and William IV."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.21.OPT1: "This smells quite nice. And healthy too, you say?"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.22.T: "Sake Dean Mahomed"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.22.D: "Sheikh Din Muhammad, or Sake Dean Mahomed, was born in 1759 in Bihar. His father worked for the East India Company, and upon his death, the ten year old Sake was adopted by a British Captain. He became a surgeon in the British Army, and fought in the war against the Marathas. When his foster father and closest friend resigned from the army, Mahomed accompanied him to Britain. \n\nHe would go on to open England's first Indian restaurant, introduce the Indian practice of shampoo to Britain, and become shampooing surgeon for two British Kings.\n\nPossibly his greatest work, however, was his book, \"The Travels of Sake Dean Mahomet\", in which he described the ancient glories of the Mughal Empire.\n\nIt has become quite popular in Europe, which in turn reflects well on us."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.22.OPT1: "Yes, we do deserve this praise."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.1.T: "Dawn of the Age of Enlightenment"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.1.D: "Following conflict and bloodshed, as well as the development of new scientific and ideological practices, the authority of religion has been shaken, and the truth of the world no longer seems as simple as it once did. Humans know more now than we ever have before, and yet the only thing we are certain of is that there are so many answers yet to find. \nNevertheless, every year sees new discoveries and ideas, and philosophers are no longer just developing traditions, but ideas and worldviews.\n\nWith these developments happening in our country as well as across Europe, we have entered the Age of Enlightenment."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.1.OPT1: "These are the times we live in."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.2.T: "Coffee House Gathering"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.2.D: "A group of philosophers, scientists and \"thinkers\" have started regularly meeting in one of our capital's newly opened coffee houses. In addition to greatly benefiting local café business, their free exchange of thoughts brings new ideas to the fore, and occasionally acts as the source of a new breakthrough that people in the know assures us is ery exciting."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.2.OPT1: "Make sure they discuss the challenges facing $COUNTRY$."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.2.OPT2: "It does little harm to let them babble freely."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.3.T: "Enlightened Absolutism"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.3.D: "While many enlightenment thinkers are critical of monarchies, and many monarchs are suspicious of enlightened ideals, there are those who realise the enlightened path is the way of the future. Ideas developed by modern philosophers can aid our bureaucracy and lend even greater legitimacy to our absolute rule. On the other hand, some of them speak of terrifying things like self-determination and pluralistic governments."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.3.OPT1: "$MONARCH$ is a modern monarch, embracing the enlightened ideals!"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.3.OPT2: "These ideas are ridiculous, and should not be legitimised."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.T: "Supporting the Scientific Revolution"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.D: "In our modern day and age, the methods of the natural scientists of antiquity are coming up short. No longer is thinking and imagining the universe enough to discover the truth. Instead, self-styled \"scientists\" have begun developing strict methodologies to ensure that the theories they posit can be tested and developed. \nIt is undeniable that this has led to some incredible advances, but although they CLAIM to be thoroughly tested, the fact is that many \"scientific\" discoveries seem to go against clerical teaching."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.OPT1: "Knowing the truth means holding the advantage. We will support them, for $COUNTRY$!"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.OPT2: "The truth has already been written out for us. It's right there in the bible!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.5.T: "Discoveries of the Scientific Revolution"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.5.D: "Following the development of new scientific practices, and greater emphasis on certainty even over sensibility, great new discoveries about our world seems to be made every other day. The human body, physics and even mathematics does not always work the way one would think, and our support for academic institutions and prolific scientists has helped greatly."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.5.OPT1: "It is time for the practical implementation of this knowledge."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.5.OPT2: "Continue striving for ever greater discoveries."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.6.T: "$COUNTRY$ Suffers From Lack of Scientific Innovation"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.6.D: "With many other countries in Europe actively supporting new developments in the eternal search for human knowledge, our insistence on adherence to the time-tested old ways means that most significant discoveries are being made elsewhere. If we do not act, $COUNTRY$ risks falling behind in crucial areas like irrigation or military ideas."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.6.OPT1: "Things will work out."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.6.OPT2: "Time to shake up our scientific establishment."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.T: "Thinker Publishes Grand Work"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.D: "With a long and winding title in modernized Latin, one of our foremost and brightest thinkers has, after decades of work, published their principal piece. Spanning many volumes and enough complex scientific formula or philosophical formulations to make anyone's head spin, they have illustrated an impeccable grasp of the world around us. \nEven if we cannot exactly claim to understand what it all means, it will cement $COUNTRY$'s position on the ideological world stage."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.OPT1: "Our magistrates should take note of this thesis on government."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.OPT2: "What a revolutionary view on the development of cultures."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.OPT3: "To even think about deploying this invention on the killing fields."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.OPT4: "What a marvellous new mill design."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.OPT5: "This new rig designs will make our ships far more durable in storms."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.g: "A new way of mixing gunpowder that will require half the resources?!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.9.T: "Philosopher Criticizes the Church"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.9.D: "One of $COUNTRY$'s most prominent Enlightenment philosophers has voiced some sharp criticism of the way the church operates in our country. \nWhile initially contained to a small circle of over-educated acquaintances, a pamphlet has now been written and is circulating with the aim of disseminating the philosopher's critique."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.9.OPT1: "We cannot pretend everything about our system is perfect."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.9.OPT2: "If we cannot prove the philosopher wrong, employ stronger measures."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.9.OPT3: "Our censorship office will ensure his ideas aren't heard."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.10.T: "Philosopher Criticizes the Government"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.10.D: "In a display of contempt for order, an Enlightenment philosopher has loudly voiced criticisms of our [Root.GovernmentName] in the public sphere. While it is abundantly clear to anyone that our ways of doing things are superior to anything found elsewhere on the continent or in the world, it is simply not good enough for this philosopher. \nWe could have ignored the criticism, of course, but for some reason people seem to be listening to the philospher, and agreeing with certain points."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.10.OPT1: "Let people talk, they are too far beneath us to understand the complexity of rule."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.10.OPT2: "Let us see if a few choice reforms calms the critics."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.11.T: "Thinker Goes Abroad"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.11.D: "In an apparent act of protest against the lack of stability and the attempt at control of public discourse in our government, one of our foremost thinkers has departed $CAPITAL$ to go abroad. While they are likely to be back - coffee just never tastes as good as the one at home, after all - their departure does not reflect well on our state."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.11.OPT1: "Cover it up as an international exchange of ideas."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.11.OPT2: "Make sure they stay where they are."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.12.T: "Military Thought Suffers Under Rationalism"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.12.D: "With the scientific concepts of empiricism and knowledge spreading into diverse ideologies as rationalism, thinkers are starting to consider many widely accepted military practices as downright barbaric. With public opinion turning against the less savoury aspects of war and bloodshed, military innovation develops slower than it should. Indeed, some even hold pacifist dreams of abolishing warfare althogether, replacing warriors with diplomats."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.12.OPT1: "We must build public support for a strong army."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.12.OPT2: "Ah, to dream of a world where peace is just as viable as warfare."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.T: "Rationalism Aids Trade"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.D: "With the development of rationalist ideas, thinkers have considered the way we have been doing trade for centuries, and found them lacking. By using samples taken from the vast number of transactions made by our merchants in markets and harbours every day, we can attempt to predict the outcome of new economic policies. Some of these ideas seem like they could be quite beneficial!"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.OPT1: "Ask thinkers to suggest some viable trade reforms for $COUNTRY$."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.OPT2: "Wait, flee flow of trade can bring in more money than mercantilism?"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.OPT3: "These ideas for new tolls are amazing!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.T: "Mercantilism Questioned"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.D: "For centuries we have adhered to the idea that our country needs to build up treasury reserves by always exporting more value than we import. While this leads to high tariffs that can sometimes contribute to famine and goods shortages, it always ensured we had cash at hand.\nHowever, the new idea seems to be that mercantilism often worsens economic downturns, and reduces the value of our national goods in the long term. While this idea is counterintuitive and quite frankly sounds ridiculous, it has enough supporters to be worth consideration."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.OPT1: "Let us take steps to test out this concept of \"free trade.\""
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.OPT2: "We need to see evidence of this before we put anything into practice."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.OPT3: "No, we have to make sure we have the most silver of all the countries!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.15.T: "Advances in Military Practices"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.15.D: "While human universalism and occasionally even pacifism are observable among a large number of thinkers in our country, occasionally one of them will do something useful by making a realisation about military doctrine. Whether it is a technological advancement, a logistical development, or a deeper understanding of soldiers and the execution of warfare, we welcome every new idea that can help us defeat the enemies lurking at our doorstep."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.15.OPT1: "Military practice is more important to us."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.15.OPT2: "Military ideology is more important to us."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.16.T: "War Criticised"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.16.D: "In a recent pamphlet that has just started circulation, a prominent and - more dangerously - popular philosopher has explained in detail why the war our nation is fighting can be seen as unjust. Obviously unfamiliar with the political complexity of the situation, the philosopher could cause great harm to the war effort if public opinion was to turn."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.16.OPT1: "Let the pamphlets spread. People know better than to not support their country's wars."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.16.OPT2: "Do everything in our power to ensure that the philosopher never criticizes $COUNTRY$ again."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.17.T: "Anti-government Radicalism"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.17.D: "The liberal ideas fronted by so many contemporary philosophers have blossomed into an entire movement. Radicals are singing their beliefs in the streets, and state soldiers are viewed with distrust. There hasn't been an open revolt yet, but so many philosophers seem to be trying to instigate exactly that.\nTheir aim is to replace our well-functioning institutions with inefficient liberal bastardisations. It should not be this way, but the thinkers of our country seem to have declared their own ideological war against the state."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.17.OPT1: "Not all their points are useless, and an awful lot of people seem to be supporting them..."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.17.OPT2: "If they want a war, then we will show them the might of a [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.T: "Anti-religious Work Circulates"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.D: "In an utterly distasteful display that not too long ago would be described as heresy, a book detailing the \"wrong\" practices of the church in $COUNTRY$ has been circulating widely for some time. While it is hardly a new reformation, it does pose some challenging questions that the clergy has answered less than well."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT1: "By the Virgin Mary, how dare they!"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT2: "Hardly ninety-five theses. Let's just ignore it."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT3: "God chooses for us all, and He chose for this philosopher to be an ass."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT3.5: "Throw this man out the nearest window NOW!"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT4: "This is an insult to a national institution."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT5: "Not too long ago indeed. Burn the philosopher on the stake for heresy!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.19.T: "A Footnote to History"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.19.D: "Ah, it seems like not so long ago we worried about criticism from a rampant philosopher. Now that we have seen the errors of our ways, those condemnations hardly seem to matter anymore."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.19.OPT1: "What were we ever concerned about."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.20.T: "The Age of Enlightenment Fades"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.20.D: "As with every age, one must fade to give way for a new. While we may not know what awaits our nation, the past centuries have taught us and the rest of Europe about the very nature of knowledge. Whatever the future brings, we know that we will be better prepared to face the unknown than we have ever been before."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.20.OPT1: "A new age dawns."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.21.T: "The Enlightenment Ends in Revolution"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.21.D: "With the dawn of the revolution, the enlightenment has come to an end. For a century and more the people of Europe have been studying the world to divine its future, and that future is eternal change. Never again will the world be shackled by the way things are and always have been, for now everyone has seen that things can be different. The world works only the way people make it. A new age has dawned, and there is fire on the horizon."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.21.OPT1: "\"We have seen the new world. To arms!\""

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.22.T: "A Literary Salon"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.22.D: "A group of writers and thinkers have started regularly meeting for events where they exchange works, comments and advise. They seem to be helping each other develop coherent arguments and craft masterful literature, while also enjoying each others company and developing ideas.\nNow a true masterpiece has sprung forth from one of these literary salons, an absolutely stunning work possibly unparallelled in our language, at least if the literary critics are to be believed."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.22.OPT1: "Make sure the work is videly circulated."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.22.OPT2: "Present it as the finest our nation has to offer."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.23.T: "Academic Society"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.23.D: "At one of our country's finest academic institutions, a group of self-styled \"scientists\" in search of knowledge has grouped together to develop standardised practices for empirical experimentation. They have published their own handbook, and the early results of their work are promising. \nIt might be that the breakthrough they are looking for would come if we \"encouraged\" them in a particularly useful direction."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.23.OPT1: "Have them look into new production methods."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.23.OPT2: "We need better methods of weighing and proofing."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.23.OPT3: "If they can't invent a new cannon, we're not interested."

 FEE_France_Events.1.T: "French Feudalism and the Hundred Years' War"
 FEE_France_Events.1.D: "In many of its aspects the institution of feudalism that defined medieval European life had its origins in France. During the 11th century, however, the “French Feudal Revolution” gave French feudalism a bewildering complexity that existed nowhere else in Europe, as holdings got broken down into ever smaller parts under the emergent classes of seigneurs and castellons. Some regions, such as Toulouse, were brought to heal, but most regions remained largely ruled by small powers with little control from Paris. \n\nThe agony of the Hundred Years' War only increased the confusion, as allegiances between the various vassals fluctuated between the Valois and Plantagenet claimants to the throne. The expense of the war left France unable to enforce feudal obligations on several more prominent vassals, but also underlined the need for centralization to mount an effective defense against foreign aggression. To truly centralize France, however, centuries of tradition, laws, and feudal contracts would, sooner or later, need to be disregarded or destroyed…"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT1: "We must centralize the Kingdom of France!"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT2: "We should remind our vassals of their military obligations!"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT3: "France is too vast to govern, we must preserve the feudal system!"

 FEE_France_Events.2.T: "Law Courts and Parlements"
 FEE_France_Events.2.D: "Power in France does not solely lie with the nobility, who exercise varying levels of independence from Paris. The rising class of lawyers, themselves centered in Paris, conduct much of the administration of the country with little oversight by the monarchy. Due to the inadequate road system, the further away from Paris the courts are, the less they tend to listen to the king. A properly unified administration of the nation must, of course, start here."
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT1: "We shall reign them in by any means necessary!"
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT2: "Let us seek to reason with them: perhaps they will help us on their own"
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT3: "§GLet the King Himself negotiate with these men§!"

 FEE_France_Events.3.T: "Regional Identities in France"
 FEE_France_Events.3.D: "France in the early modern period was a vast and populous land: by some measures the largest and most populous realm in the Western World, and certainly the largest to be claimed by one hereditary monarch, as opposed to the elective monarchy of the more populous but divided Holy Roman Empire. Despite the greater political unity, people in the various regions of France clung to their local identities rather than considering themselves Frenchmen, especially further away from the capital."
 FEE_France_Events.3.OPT1: "It is time we create a France for the French! "
 FEE_France_Events.3.OPT2: "Let the provincials be themselves, I don't care"

 FEE_France_Events.4.T: "Paris Seeks Control"
 FEE_France_Events.4.D: "Now that the war with England is finally over, instead of resting on their victory, it seems the French king has decided to curtail our God-given rights as local rulers and impose his own autocratic will on us. Needless to say, as semi-independent nobles in France, it falls to us to stand for the nobility across France and remind the King from whence his power comes."
 FEE_France_Events.4.OPT1: "We must send a delegation to Paris to assert our rights!"
 FEE_France_Events.4.OPT2: "There is nothing we can really do"

 FEE_France_Events.5.T: "French Feudal Lords Oppose the King"
 FEE_France_Events.5.D: "Seeking to preserve their long-standing feudal prerogatives, the nobility remains a powerful force that largely opposes the recent royal efforts at centralization. Our recent efforts at increasing royal control have caused a delegation of France's most powerful nobles, the semi-independent vassals of the crown, and others to approach the king and demand that our course be reversed."
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT1: "Ignore them!"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT2: "We can afford to reverse course a little"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT3: "Let us attempt to give carrots as well as sticks"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT4: "We must crush this arrogance now! "

 FEE_France_Events.6.T: "King Rejects our Demands"
 FEE_France_Events.6.D: "Our thinly veiled demand for protection of our rights and privileges was dismissed out-of-hand by the King in Paris. "
 FEE_France_Events.6.OPT1: "Perhaps it is time we show the king who really holds power in France…"
 FEE_France_Events.6.OPT2: "We cannot contend with the King of France"

 FEE_France_Events.7.T: "Noble Leaders Arrested!"
 FEE_France_Events.7.D: "In an unexpected turn of events, the French king has responded in the worst way possible to our demands. Arresting some leaders and having others secretly killed, most of the delegation to Paris will not be returning to their extensive land holdings any time soon…"
 FEE_France_Events.7.OPT1: "§Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! will rue the day!"

 FEE_France_Events.8.T: "The Second Estate"
 FEE_France_Events.8.D: "While the nobility of France keep much of the King's attention due to their vast land holdings and military power, the clergy are equally a political force to be reckoned with. At times the French clergy have controlled upwards of 40% of the nation's wealth in endowments that under French law could only increase, never decrease. The French Crown did, at least wrest the power to appoint bishops and cardinals during the medieval Investiture crisis, but the clergy are also a more unified force in opposition to the king than the often-squabbling nobility. If [Root.Monarch.GetName] can leverage what concessions he already has, he can overcome the clergy's resistance to centralization. If not…"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT1: "Seize Clergy Land and Curtail their Influence!"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT2: "Negotiate to gain their support for royal power"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT3: "Do not disturb the clergy"

 FEE_France_Events.9.T: "Clergy Refuses!"
 FEE_France_Events.9.D: "Our attempts at negotiating with the church have been met with arrogant dismissal at the hands of the leading clergymen of the realm. Saying that “your power comes from God just as ours does,” they refuse to relinquish any of their political power in our realm. In response to our attempts to use investiture to leverage influence, they have reignited the feud between church and king over the right to appoint church officials."
 FEE_France_Events.9.OPT1: "Ingrates!"
 FEE_France_Events.9.OPT2: "This has gone far enough - the King of France rules the church!"

 FEE_France_Events.10.T: "Clergy Accepts"
 FEE_France_Events.10.D: "Our overtures were accepted by the Second Estate! Whether through respect for the divine rule of the king, or from fear of the king's power over investiture, prominent clerics led a ceremony of reaffirmation of the French king's authority over the church."
 FEE_France_Events.10.OPT1: "Wonderful!"

 FEE_France_Events.11.T: "Re-Trial of Jeanne D'Arc"
 FEE_France_Events.11.D: "In the year 1429, the Hundred years war was still raging on. With much of Northern France under the Anglo-Burgundian alliance, France was in a weak position. That same year, a peasant girl named Jeanne D'Arc, instructed by voices of angels, went into the royal court of Chinon where king Charles VII, along with many military leaders, to Orleans in order to defeat the English. In the ensuing battle, she earned the nickname 'Maid of Orleans'. Later on in her life, she helped the king be crowned at Reims, and led an unsuccessful attack to reclaim the city of Paris. In the year 1431, she was captured by the Burgundians who sold her to the English, and she was trialed and executed in the city of Rouen.\n\nNow, with the support of the Pope, the university of Paris, and the city of Rouen at our hand, the trial has been re-done, with over 115 witnesses testifying of the maid's purity. This will eliminate any claims that the kingdom was reclaim using a sorceress, thus removing any threats of undermining our legitimacy."
 FEE_France_Events.11.OPT1: "The English fops have been beaten once again."

 FEE_France_Events.12.T: "The Bourgeoisie Request Concessions"
 FEE_France_Events.12.D: "While the nobility and clergy estate have historically been the most powerful in France, the support of the bourgeoisie has always been vital to shore up royal support both within Paris, by far the largest urban center of France, and the outlying cities. The cities, which provide much of the trade wealth of France, bend the knee to neither nobles nor priests. Thus, the bourgeoisie, also known as the Third Estate, controls a disproportionate amount of the wealth that reaches the King's coffers. \nWord of our recent efforts at tighter administration have reached the towns dominated by the Third Estate. They are worried about their rights and privileges that make their cities attractive for trade and business in the first place, and that the crown might seek to repeal them."
 FEE_France_Events.12.OPT1: "They are nothing but lowborns! We govern as we wish!"
 FEE_France_Events.12.OPT2: "We can't do anything against them"

 FEE_France_Events.13.T: "Conflict Between King and Cities"
 FEE_France_Events.13.D: "The Third Estate has decidedly split with the royal authority in Paris over the crown's refusal to continue guaranteeing their rights and privileges. Much of France's small but growing urban population is now suspicious of every move the King makes that might threaten their freedoms. Their fears have caused them to seek support from the outlying dukes and princes of the French periphery. Some bourgeoisie have approached us offering financial support and men. By joining their own resources with ours, we can present a united front against any encroachment from Paris."
 FEE_France_Events.13.OPT1: "We thank them for their support!"
 FEE_France_Events.13.OPT2: "What they say is treason, enough of this!"

 FEE_France_Events.14.T: "A Regular Army"
 FEE_France_Events.14.D: "Throughout the feudal world, the social order could be simplified as “those who fought for all (the nobility), those who prayed for all (the clergy), and those who worked for all (everyone else).” In the 1400s this social order seemed as strong as ever, but in practice warfare was often much less idealistic. The strain on the feudal levies caused by the Hundred Years' War caused the French king to rely ever more heavily on mercenaries. These ragtag armies were often poorly disciplined and cruel to the populace they were supposed to protect. \n\nIn 1445, in the aftermath of the Surrender of Maine, the first real attempt was made to reorganize the army, but mercenaries still dominated the battlefield. Those fiefs ruled directly by the Crown are more than adequate to supply a large standing army if the Crown were to institute more rigorous recruiting; however, the manpower of our vassals is not to be underestimated; nor are the consequences of demanding too much from the French peasantry in the place of mercenaries."
 FEE_France_Events.14.OPT1: "We must remind our nobles of their obligations!"
 FEE_France_Events.14.OPT2: "We can squeeze enough men from our own land"
 FEE_France_Events.14.OPT3: "We should continue relying on mercenaries"

 FEE_France_Events.15.T: "The Provencal Claims"
 FEE_France_Events.15.D: "The Dukes of Provence have proven mightily ambitious in recent years, claiming every vacant throne from Aragon to Jerusalem. When all is said and done, however, they are nothing but a mere scion of the Valois dynasty which rules France, the greatest crown in Europe outside the Emperor himself. This junior part of the family has managed to secure itself de jure French possessions far and wide, has proclaimed themselves a kingdom, and even claims as core territory land that is our own core territory! \n\nNeedless to say, the lofty ambitions of this cadet branch threaten to interfere with ours. While the Anjou princes have tried their best to maintain good relations, perhaps it is in our best interest to reconsider their alliance with us..."
 FEE_France_Events.15.OPT1: "It is time that Provence acknowledges our rule"
 FEE_France_Events.15.OPT2: "We should support our Provencal cousins, not repress them"

 FEE_France_Events.16.T: "The Breton Question"
 FEE_France_Events.16.D: "While the Bretons were included in the old Carolingian Empire, the last bastion of Celtic presence in mainland Europe was quick to regain it's independence. Gifted with deft diplomats, they negotiated our respect for their sovereignty in exchange for neutrality in the Hundred Years' War. Now that the English have been evicted from France, however, this promise of neutrality is no longer relevant. More relevant is the promise of the treaty that Brittany will swear fealty and tribute to the rightful King of France. \n\nTreaty or not, the fact remains that the Bretons occupy land that is rightfully part of the French crown. Whether we choose to act on our legal rights, however, depends on the diplomatic consequences of doing so."
 FEE_France_Events.16.OPT1: "The Bretons must bend the knee to us!"
 FEE_France_Events.16.OPT2: "We must at least receive our rightful tribute"
 FEE_France_Events.16.OPT3: "We have no need of land in Brittany, if they want it they can have it."

 FEE_France_Events.17.T: "France Demands Tribute"
 FEE_France_Events.17.D: "In the Second Treaty of Guerande, we managed to stave off French attempts at annexing us by promising both neutrality in the Hundred Years' War and swearing a nominal fealty to France. Now, envoys from Paris have arrived, claiming that fealty be given. While not an overt demand at subjugation or annexation, it is a claim of overlordship and demand for tribute that weighs seriously on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s mind. Furthermore, the envoys of Paris claim that tribute must be paid, not only for this year but all the years since the treaty was signed over two generations ago."
 FEE_France_Events.17.OPT1: "We have no choice but to accept"
 FEE_France_Events.17.OPT2: "We are independent and owe nothing to France!"

 FEE_France_Events.18.T: "Brittany Accepts"
 FEE_France_Events.18.D: "True to their word, the Duke of Brittany has agreed to pay in full the tribute that he owes us!"
 FEE_France_Events.18.OPT1: "Excellent! We need nothing more from them."

 FEE_France_Events.19.T: "Brittany Refuses"
 FEE_France_Events.19.D: "Valuing their precious coin above their sacred oaths, the Bretons have refuse to pay us tribute!"
 FEE_France_Events.19.OPT1: "They will pay us, one way or another!"

 FEE_France_Events.20.T: "Scottish Mercenaries"
 FEE_France_Events.20.D: "The ties between Scotland and France by 1444 were deep. In addition to the Auld Alliance, Scots have been travelling to France to serve as fighters in the relatively lucrative wars on the continent, seeking wealth and fame, as far back as Charlemagne. Scots mercenaries quickly became known in France for their strength and sometimes mad courage, fighting in several key battles of the Hundred Years' War. Many Scots even of noble blood found service in the French armies. \nA few of the best among the Scots were picked out by Charles VII in 1418 to serve as a special corps, first as frontline troops and later as his royal bodyguard. With our renewed focus on mercenary armies, it is only fair that we give this guard special consideration."
 FEE_France_Events.20.OPT1: "Institutionalize the Scots Guard!"
 FEE_France_Events.20.OPT2: "Nonsense! We do not need them."

 FEE_France_Events.21.T: "Sampiero Corso"
 FEE_France_Events.21.D: "Sampiero Corso was a member of the lower Corsican nobility who sought his fortune as an Italian Condottieri. His exploits would eventually bring him into the service of the French king, for which he was granted the governorship of Aix-en-Provence. In 1553, however, during France's war with Genoa, Sampiero Corso returned to Corsica to lead a rebellion against the Genoese. Although he was successful in securing Corsica's allegiance to France, the island would be returned to Genoa in the peace treaty of Cateau Cambrésis between France and Spain in 1559."
 FEE_France_Events.21.OPT1: "A Corsican rebellion can only be good for us!"

 FEE_France_Events.23.T: "Sampiero Corso"
 FEE_France_Events.23.D: "Living from 1498 to 1567, Sampiero Corso was a Corsican lower noble and soldier. He grew up to become a condottieri, and fought for several paymasters in Italy. Eventually he came into the service of the French king, where his familiarity with Corsica became an advantage to the French efforts in Italy. \nNow it seems that our ruthless enemies in France has chosen to send Sampiero Corso in an attempt to free Corsica for later French occupation!"
 FEE_France_Events.23.OPT1: "Curse that man, and curse all the kings of France!"

 FEE_France_Events.22.T: "Poor Internal Toll System"
 FEE_France_Events.22.D: "In the 17th and 18th century, France had dozens of different laws for how different goods were to be taxed when transported between provinces. To make matters worse, different laws applied to different provinces, causing multiple tolls to be paid by merchants travelling across the country. Not only did this discourage trade and transportation, it made it so that it was often cheaper to import goods from abroad, rather than from a neighboring city.\nIt was also up to local signeurs to apply the taxation laws, which meant that there was no regulation on lords that charged far more than they legally should. In the middle of the 18th century, it was estimated that the cost of transporting 500 livres worth of wine from Muret to Paris was 501 livres, paying for dozens of tolls along the way. The provincial regulations meant that the same amount of salt could cost twenty times as much on one side of a river as on the other."
 FEE_France_Events.22.OPT1: "Administrating a country is no easy task."
 FEE_France_Events.22.OPT2: "We need to reform our toll system!"

 FEE_France_Events.101.T: "Surrender of Maine Setup"
 FEE_France_Events.101.D: "You shouldn't be able to see this hidden event."
 FEE_France_Events.101.OPT1: "Please report it to the team if you see it."

 FEE_France_Events.201.T: "End of Scots Mercenaries"
 FEE_France_Events.201.D: "You shouldn't be able to see this hidden event."
 FEE_France_Events.201.OPT1: "Please report it to the team if you see it."

 FEE_Gelre_Events.1.T: "The Revolt of Adolf van Egmond"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.1.D: "In 1465, the first Egmond duke of Gelre, Alfred, suffered a rebellion from his son, Adolf. Adolf was supported by not only the fourmajor cities of Gelre, but also by the Duke of Burgundy.\n\nArnold was imprisoned, and his son seized power. His favour was short-lived, however, and the continued struggle for power would culminate in the sale of the right of succession in Gelre to the Dukes of Burgundy."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.1.OPT1: "We will destroy Adolf's revolt!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.1.OPT2: "Let's ensure the Duke of Burgundy supports our side."

 FEE_Gelre_Events.2.T: "Burgundy Demands a Compromise!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.2.D: "Following the turmoil in our country, our powerful neighbour the Duke of Burgundy has demanded that our power struggles cease bringing instability to the region.\n\nThings can certainly not continue as they have, but only one solution has been found to ensure the continued prosperity of our little duchy. The Duke of Burgundy might be willing to pay a significant amount of gold to receive the right of inheritance of $COUNTRY$. This would ensure that the nobles fighting over the right to rule would be bypassed. Although we would swear fealty under a foreign ruler, we would also be able to line our coffers quite handsomely."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.2.OPT1: "Offer the ruler of Burgundy the right to rule."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.2.OPT2: "We can sort these troubles ourselves!"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.3.T: "The Compromise of Gelre"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.3.D: "Following recent instabilities in their country, and the worry that a power struggle will spread across their borders, our diplomats have presented to the Gelreans an irresistible offer.\n\n To avoid further infighting, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Burgundy may buy the right to succession in Gelre, thus bypassing the fighting parties. This would require us to dig deep in our coffers, but would expand our influence in the Low Countries."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.3.OPT1: "We will do everything in our power to solve the crisis of Gelre."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.3.OPT2: "Let us only offer them diplomatic support, not protection."

 FEE_Gelre_Events.4.T: "Burgundy Accepts the Compromise"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.4.D: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of Burgundy has accepted our offer of a political solution! They will now protect ourlands, and we now have an enormous ducal grant to develop our duchy."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.4.OPT1: "Sweet, sweet gold!"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.5.T: "Burgundy Refuses the Compromise!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.5.D: "Blaming a lack of funds, Burgundy has offended us with a move of diplomatic betrayal. They have refused our offer of union!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.5.OPT1: "We should stop fighting among ourselves and look to our enemies on the outside..."

 FEE_Gelre_Events.6.T: "Claims to the Duchy of Gelre "
 FEE_Gelre_Events.6.D: "While Gelre has only recently become independent of Julich under personal union, the Duke of Gelre, Arnold van Egmond, is a man of great ambition. He seeks to become a strong Duke in his own right, competing with the influence of the Duke of Burgundy and the Habsburgs. \nHowever, Arnold's reign in Gelre itself is far from stable. His equally ambitious son, Adolf, while young, may yet try to have him removed, and the nobles and burghers of Gelre are hardly friendly to Arnold's ambitions either. \nGelre bring relatively poor among the Lowland realms means that an influx of cash may very well stabilize the situation and give the Duke of Gelre the boost he needs to project dominance over the surrounding princes. The Duke of Burgundy might be able to oblige... in return for certain concessions."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.6.OPT1: "Make the offer"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.6.OPT2: "We don't need the help of Burgundian"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.7.T: "Gelre Requests Financial Aid"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.7.D: "An emissary from the Duke of Guelders has arrived at our court requesting an audience. He claims that the Duke desires a loan from our Duke, which he would use to fight the other princes in the Lowlands. Naturally this would help us by distracting potential enemies. However, our advisors are concerned that Duke Arnold may simply renege on the loan. In response, the Gelderland diplomat says that the Duke is willing to offer just about anything as collateral for a generous loan."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.7.OPT1: "Only the title of Duke of Guelders is worth such a price. Take it or leave it"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.8.T: "Burgundy's Proposal"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.8.D: "In exchange for his loan, the Duke of Burgundy has demanded that Duke Arnold hand over his title as Duke as collateral for the loan, meaning that, if he doesn't pay it back, the Duke of Burgundy may add yet another title to his already substantial list. \nNaturally, when the nobility and burghers of the realm heard of this deal they were outraged. They demand that this deal be rejected to preserve Gelre's sovereignty."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.8.OPT1: "Just give me the money!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.8.OPT2: "The Burgundians ask for too much! No deal!"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.9.T: "The Bill Comes Due"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.9.D: "The Duke is dead! Even as his body was laid to rest, representatives of the ever-meddlesome Burgundians have arrived, demanding repayment in full of their loan, and threatening to seize the Duchy if we don't. Our people never supported the making of the deal in the first place, and they certainly will not brook such a financially burdensome repayment. However, the prospect of subjugation under Burgundy is not an option likely to receive much favor either."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.9.OPT1: "A contract is a contract. We must pay."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.9.OPT2: "If they want the Duchy, they'll have to come and take it"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.10.T: "The Guelders Wars"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.10.D: "Disputes over titles between the Duke of Guelders and his neighbors have resulted in on and off conflict with Gelre for decades. However, given limited resources, no decisive military engagement has been fought, the war being largely fought as a series of border raids and skirmishes. \nIn addition to defending his own title, the Duke aspires to build a strong nation-state in his own right in the Lowlands, competing with Burgundian and Imperial influence. His reputation for not paying back loans led to a shortage of funds for this ambitious project. Gelre, therefore, opted to allow its troops free rein to pillage and plunder in place of regular pay. Needless to say, this has resulted in increased suffering for those on the front lines, and promises great destruction, should one of the major Lowlands cities fall to them..."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.10.OPT1: "So be it"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.11.T: "Sack of Hague"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.11.D: "The long and bloody Guelders Wars have finally moved out of the inland interior of the Lowlands and have struck the prosperous coast of Holland itself! \nThe now-legendary looting prowess of Gelderland troops was unleashed on the historic capital of Holland, The Hague. The looting continued for days until order was finally restored."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.11.OPT1: "Sounds good to me!"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.12.T: "Duke of Guelders Dies"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.12.D: "When the last Duke of Guelders with a strong claim died without an heir, he had done everything in his power to ensure that his prized Duchy went to anyone other than the Emperor, who had a legal claim on it based on the Burgundian claim established all those years ago. \nThe closest living relative lay in the Duke of Berg, the nation which have subjugated Gelre and from which Gelre had broken off in 1438."

 FEE_Genoa_Events.1.D: "A lighthouse had kept watch over Genoa for centuries, but it wasn't until 1543 construction finished on what would become known as the Lanterna, the tallest lighthouse in the world for more than 350 years. Standing at the edge of the city, overlooking the entrance to the harbour, the lighthouse guided ships safely to land.

 FEE_Genoa_Events.2.D: "Living from 1498 to 1567, Sampiero Corso was a Corsican lower noble and soldier. He grew up to become a condottieri, and fought for several paymasters in Italy. Eventually he came into the service of the French king, where his familiarity with Corsica became an advantage to the French efforts in Italy. \nNow it seems that our ruthless enemies in France has chosen to send Sampiero Corso in an attempt to free Corsica for later French occupation!"

Sponsored by Great Britain, Paoli not only managed to drive the Genoese off the island, but also reorganised the government into a functioning state, complete with a university and its own mint. Although the republic would fall to France in 1769, Paolis reforms advanced the island significantly, and international recognition of the Corsican people as a distinct culture."

 FEE_Genoa_Events.4.T: "Casa San Giorgio on Corsica"
 FEE_Genoa_Events.4.D: "The distance from Genoa to Corsica was an administrative challenge, and war or local dissent could make it impossible for the doge to exert any political power on the island. As the Bank of Saint George became a major creditor for Genoa, they acquired the right to collect taxes on Corsica, provided they also protected the island. \nWhile the bank treated Genoese settlers preferentially over locals, it did much to develop the island, especially the towns and fortifications along the coast. However, the bank's taxation would eventually grow to wear as heavily on the locals as the republic's had, and provided the driving force of the Corsican movement to replace Genoese authority with French."

No one knows exactly what has caused this unusual year, although reports of a massive volcanic eruption in the East Indies seem to coincide with it. The effects, however, are worldwide. \nIn Asia, the monsoons were disrupted, causing floods in China and India, while in northern Europe the constant rain and low temperatures caused massive crop failures. In North America, grain crops failed and many were reduced to boiling herbs for sustenance. Around the world, a wave of cholera, typhus, and other diseases typically associated with poverty and starvation followed quickly on the heels of food shortages. \nPrices have risen dramatically as desperate people are willing to sell their very souls for bread, even as many lose their homes and are reduced to begging. Large estates, many already in debt from lavish living, now teeter on the verge of bankruptcy. The widespread shortages have led to a sharp increase in violence as rioters chanting “Bread or Blood” demand food that doesn't exist."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.T: "The Irmandiño Revolts"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.D: "As the Spanish kingdoms focused on the southwards reconquest of Iberia against the Moors, the traditional northern heartland regions often became neglected. \nGalicia in particular became a hotbed of instability during the latter half of the 15th century, as noble and clerical power were evenly divided in the region, and the poor weather of the Little Ice Age hit Galicia's temperate climate especially hard. As the nobles and clergy squabbled for power, the peasants, lower nobility and merchants were increasingly oppressed, including outright banditry from the nobles and extortion from the priests. \nNow, the Galicians can stand it no longer. At first gathering in secret, the Irmandiños (brotherhood) have now armed the people, who have now risen up in revolt against their oppressors! Targeting the nobility in particular, they have already destroyed dozens of castles, and the nobility have now come to both us and the king of Portugal, desperate for our aid."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.D: "While not of one of the major noble families of Galicia, and even rumored to be a bastard, Pedro Madruga was a peerless example of the best of medieval knighthood in Galicia. While courteous, even-tempered, and polite, he was also a fierce warrior and became exceptionally skilled in all areas of warfare. Travelling between Castile and Portugal only facilitated his study of different and advanced battle techniques, both on land and at sea. \nDespite all this, he would never have become known were it not for the Irmandiños Revolts. He personally led the victorious royal and noble troops to victory, and was the first to introduce the early modern arquebus to northern Iberia, a factor which no doubt was vital to his victory."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.T: "The Autonomous Regions"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.D: "The question of the various constituent kingdoms of our realm has always been a nagging one for the Catholic monarchs of Iberia. The very fact that many of them were recognized by Popes past as kingdoms in their own right has been a source of contention, as nobility and peasant alike have felt unrepresented in our court, causing widespread resentment. \nWith the Reconquista complete, now is the time to reorganize these outlying regions. [Root.Consort.GetName] has recently come up with the idea of a national Cortes where each region has their own representation. [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, desiring increased power in these regions, would prefer a viceroyalty. This would allow some local rule while still maintaining a dependence on the crown. However, this likely would not satisfy the regions. Most radical of all would be either withdrawing royal authority or attempting to assert total control."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.4.D: "With the Basque people finally fully integrated into our realm, the question of how best to manage their affairs remains to be settled. Being one of the oldest and most proud kingdoms of Christian Iberia, the former kingdom of Navarra stubbornly guarded its ancient institutions. \nAmong those was the Fueros, the royal charter of Navarra which not only gave Navarra kingdom rank but granted considerable autonomy to its nobles and guaranteed rights to its peasants. Now, representatives of these parties have approached us, requesting that we continue to respect these rights. In exchange, they promise their fullest support for us in other internal and external affairs."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.D: "From it's very beginning as a march of the Carolingian Empire, Catalonia has diverged from the rest of Iberia in maintaining its unique laws and customs, some derived from Salic law, and some even from pre-Roman times. Over time, these customs were codified in the Usatges and later in the four great institutions of Catalonia. These were: the Consell de Cent, Las Corts Generals, the Consulat del Mar, and the Generalitat de Catalunya, representing the nobility, lawyers, traders, and the general estates, respectively. \nThese institutions have been maintained even under the dominion of the crown of Aragon, and now the Catalonians petition us to continue their rights as well."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.6.D: "As Spanish monarchs take steps to promote their rule as absolute monarchs over the whole of Iberia, one region in particular has not forgotten their ancient rights and privileges; in fact, many there still believe that those privileges are theirs by right. The Institutions of Catalonia have become a rallying standard for the preservation of rights in the face of royal absolutism. \nEven more infuriating to the Catalonians is the increasingly outward focus of the Spanish crown, with quests for the new world and domination of Europe leaving their Mediterranean-focused and trade-dependent cities behind. Now, the Catalonians are demanding their ancient rights be encoded in an inviolable Constitution, a thing heretofore unheard of in the Iberian kingdoms. \nIf we do not act quickly, this simmering resentment might boil into outright revolt. Groups of militia known as “El Segadores” have already been gathering arms and rousing the populace with fiery invectives against our \"tyranny\""

 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.D: "[227.GetName] is in ruins! On All Saints' Day 1755, one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded struck just 200 kilometers off the coast of Portugal, rocking the nation completely. Portugal was typically earthquake-prone, [227.GetName] in particular having been severely damaged before in prior disasters. This earthquake proved to be like no other though, the death toll estimated to be about 40,000 and the great capital of Portugal destroyed, through earthquake, tsunami or fire. The earthquake itself was reported to have created crevices 5 metres wide in the city centre. Many retreated to the open spaces of the docks, to see the sea retreat to display a barren, muddy plain. Roughly an hour after the earthquake, a colossal tsunami ripped through [227.GetName] up the River Tejo, destroying all in its path. The shaking and shockwaves from the earthquake and its subsequent tsunami knocked over all varieties of candle and set the city ablaze, turning the already ruined city into a firestorm. \nBy the time the disaster was over, 85% of [227.GetName] was destroyed and countless works of art, literature, architecture and history were lost. King Joseph I and his court were, by sheer luck, out of [227.GetName] due to his daughter's wish to spend All Saints' Day away from the capital. King Joseph himself developed claustrophobia due to the tragedy, and was terrified of living within walls for the rest of his life, instead opting to move the court to a mass of tents on the outskirts of [227.GetName]. The prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal used this to gain power, leveraging the earthquake to take control of the royal court, and establish himself as the primary political figure in Portugal through his handling of the disaster."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.D: "Initially starting as a humble Franciscan friar, Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros was thrown in prison for his disagreements with the archbishop of Toledo (who is no stranger to meddling in our own affairs as well!). Upon his release, Jimenez devoted his life to reforming the church, gaining such a reputation for holiness that he became archbishop himself, as well as personal confessor of Isabella de Castilla and cardinal. \nConvoking long-overdue synods, Jimenez rooted out most, if not all, clerical corruption in Spain. Beyond this, however, he sponsored schools for the laity, oversaw the flooding of Castilian markets with translated devotional texts, and spread a new school of mystical through in clergy and laity alike. Essentially, his reforms were almost single-handedly responsible for reviving the piety of the Spanish people, purging corruption, and making Spain into the devout Catholic bastion of the early modern world, unlike any other in the world."

In addition, it harmonized Renaissance humanist ideas with solid Catholic dogma in a way no other clerical school did. During the Reformation years, it would grow to become a powerhouse of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, sending trained priests to hold back reformers in Ireland, France, and Italy as well as producing many missionaries for Spain's overseas territories."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.D: "Since at least the 8th century, the Catholic Popes have made repeated reference to the \"Donation of Constantine\" said to be an imperial decree of the ancient Emperor Constantine himself, giving the Pope political authority over Western Rome as well as spiritual power. \nIndeed, it is this very claim to authority under the doctrine of Translatio Imperii that provides legitimacy for the Holy Roman Empire itself! \nThe legitimacy of the Donation has been questioned since the 11th century for various reasons. Now, however, a philological scholar in our own court has completed a years-long analysis of what is said to be the source document for this sweeping claim to power. By pointing out linguistic inconsistencies, he makes a convincing proof that the document is, in fact, a reprehensible forgery. Indeed, the scholar, named Lorenzo Valla, claims the forgery is so obvious that even the current Pope must be complicit to use it so brazenly. \nMaking this known to the world, however, given the great importance that the Donation has assumed, would make a lot of enemies, and risks undermining the church itself! At the same time, it could shore up our own claims in Italy… \nPredictably, the Inquisition has demanded we turn Valla over to be tried for heresy. How shall we proceed?"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.D: "Building on the reforms of Jimenez de Cisneros, priest Juan de Avila became a staunch advocate for the reform of the clergy, almost forseeing the religious turmoil to come due to clergy corruption. Selling his entire inherited wealth to benefit the poor as an example, he undertook a remarkable journey as an itinerant preacher through Andalusia, ministering to the poor and railing against clergy abuses, especially the practice of nobility of setting up their children in a comfortable lifestyle as priests. Understandably them, his preaching of revival (recogimiento) led to resentment among some powerful families. \nNow, certain noble families have captured him and dragged him before the Royal Inquisition, demanding he recant and be silenced."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.14.D: "The oldest of all the monastic orders, the Benedictines have thrived throughout Europe, but especially in Spain. The independence of individual monasteries historically set them apart from their competitors and fostered a more austere and purer lifestyle, but it has also introduced disunity and confusion in their ranks. \nNow, as we confront the reformation, it is imperative that we assist these holy men in reaffirming their original vows and make the Order into a worthy example for our own more official holy orders."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.16.D: "The new Jesuit order founded by Ignatius de Loyola has taken both Catholics and Protestants by surprise with its new-found tenacity, zeal, and above all effectiveness. Unique among all holy orders was their vow to accept any and all missions given by the Pope in Rome. This combined with an acute awareness of the importance of Catholic education has made them the spearhead of the Counter-Reformation. Protestants have even taken to calling them the \"shock troops of the pope.\" Indeed, they have even become renowned experts of spycraft as they are trained to effortlessly blend in and evangelize even in kingdoms hostile to the Pope. \nTheir ambitious mission, to found Catholic schools all over Europe, and indeed the world, and staff those schools with the best and brightest minds in all fields, could potentially make them a potent force for us! However, as of now their ambitious outstrip their resources. Besides, with unmatched zeal and papal control and sanction comes great power, perhaps eventually too great for the Most Catholic Monarch of Spain to handle."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.D: "The Societas Jesu has been extremely successful in its mission of conversion, education, and subversion, exploding onto the scene of the Age of Reformation like an artillery barrage upon those who would see the Catholic church fall. Additionally, as their success has grown, so to has their independence, and even the Pope to whom they still swear obedience exercises little control over them. \nNow, murmuring rumors about a sinister side of the Jesuits seem to have been borne out: a former Jesuit has brought to light a terrifying book: allegedly a compilation of carefully laid plans to overthrow monarchies throughout Europe and even destroy the Papacy itself! \nWhile it is unclear the extent to which this is true, it is true that the Jesuits' iron grip on childhood education gives it much power, and public opinion has started to shift decidedly against them. Even the Papacy is taking steps to condemn and possibly dismantle the Order."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.OPT1: "Ignore these vile rumors!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.OPT2: "It's time we curtail the power of the Order!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.T: "The Poor Laws"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.D: "Despite the many differences between the various branches of the Reformation, one thing all sides agree on is how disgraceful it is for any society to have large numbers of neglected poor, forced to beg to survive. \nMany Protestant and Reformed realms have already sought to reform charity as the traditional church charity structure loses its standing and resources, seeking to put extensive governmentfunded measures in place instead. The time has come for us to make a decision on whether to follow them or not."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.OPT1: "Pass the Poor Laws."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.OPT2: "Do Not!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.T: "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.D: "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo was the first viceroy of Naples to effectively govern the kingdom on behalf of the Spanish crown. While issuing grand construction projects and modernizing the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government. \nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.OPT1: "His work in Naples makes the Crown proud."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.OPT2: "His talent should be used in other parts of our empire."

 FEE_Irish_Events.1.T: "Yorkists seek Irish support"
 FEE_Irish_Events.1.D: "As the War of the Roses rages on, Richard York himself, the Yorkist contender for the English throne, arrived in Ulaidh to seek the support of the Irish earls. He had previously been assigned as \"Lieutenant of Ireland,\" a largely meaningless title designed to keep him away from England. However, his time here has lent him sympathy among many of the clans, as well as contacts to turn that sympathy into military force. \nIn exchange for our recognition of him as the rightful King of England, he promises great favor to Ireland should be prevail against the Lancastrians."
 FEE_Irish_Events.1.OPT1: "An excellent opportunity! Our full support is behind the Yorkists!"
 FEE_Irish_Events.1.OPT2: "Who does this Englishman think he is? Support Richard's enemies!"
 FEE_Irish_Events.1.OPT3: "English conflicts are not our affair."

 FEE_Irish_Events.2.T: "Yorkists Grateful for Our Aid"
 FEE_Irish_Events.2.D: "Due to his long stay in Ireland, Richard was unusually appreciative of Irish aid in gaining his current place on the throne of England. Because of this, plans have been set in motion for our benefit! A new era of peace, trade, and development may be upon us."
 FEE_Irish_Events.2.OPT1: "Our allegiance has paid off!"

 FEE_Irish_Events.3.T: "English Angered by Irish Meddling"
 FEE_Irish_Events.3.D: "Despite our support, Richard of York ultimately failed to make good on his claim to the English throne. While doubtless the ruling house of England would probably have ignored our help if we had indeed offered it, our aid to their enemies has brought us their unwanted attention. We must rush to prepare our defenses in case they launch a retaliatory invasion!"

 FEE_Irish_Events.4.T: "Foreign Diplomats Arrive at Court"
 FEE_Irish_Events.4.D: "War with England is all but inevitable, as their expansion into our sacred homeland runs up against our own quest to unite the Irish people. Knowing this, diplomats from the European mainland have arrived in rapid succession, all of whom represent realms with strategic interest in keeping England in check. \nEach of them demands something in return, however. We must consider carefully which great power we become indebted to, and whether the aid they so eagerly promise against England is worth it."

 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.100.T: "Guerra del Gesso"
 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.100.D: "The little more than twenty-year-old King of France [FRA.Monarch.GetName], through his paternal grandmother, Maria of Anjou (1404-1463), claimed a distant hereditary right to the crown of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1492 he directed the resources of his kingdom towards the conquest of that realm, encouraged by Ludovico Sforza, called Il Moro (who was not yet Duke of Milan but was only its regent) and urged by his advisors, Guillaume Briçonnet and de Vers. \nThe reconquest of the largest kingdom of the Peninsula, already ruled by the House of Anjou (from 1282 to 1442), did not include, in the projects of [SPA.Monarch.GetName], Sicily. Through the conquest of the kingdom of Naples the king of France could have not simply increased the dominions of his House, an ambition common to many Middle-European or Anglo-Saxon ruling houses, but rather made them the starting point for those Crusades whose echo had been reinvigorated by the expulsion of the Arabs from the last Spanish possession, the Kingdom of Granada (1492). The political project of Res Publica Christiana Pro Recuperanda Terra Sancta still had a hold in the European aristocracies, even though the eight Crusades aimed at realizing it ended in disaster. The King of France himself, Louis IX, lost his life during the Eighth Crusade. Acre, the last Christian stronghold, fell definitively in 1291."

 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.102.T: "Battaglia di Fornovo"
 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.102.D: "After a few years of preparation and having secured peace treaties with his neighbours, [FRA.Monarch.GetName] departed France in August 1494 at the head of an army of around 30.000 men, including 8000 swiss mercenaries and a modern artillery park. \n[FRA.Monarch.GetName] continued his march and after sacking Pontremoli he crossed the Apennines, where he was blocked at the village of Fornovo by the assembled army of the League of Venice. The Italian army was composed mostly of condottieri hired by Venice, with only a quarter of those being Milanese as their main force was preoccupied at Novara. They were led by the Marquise of Mantova, Gianfrancesco the Second Gonzaga. \nThe Italian forces compromised mostly of heavy nights, with support from light cavalry and stradioti from the Balkans, alongside a big host of infantry and a few artillery pieces, for a total of 20.000 men lead by many nobles from the grazing lands of Romagna, such as the leaders of Bologna, Rimini, Ferrara, and Urbino. \nThe french side was around half the size of the Italian League mostly composed of armoured knights and the host of Swiss mercenaries who composed the spearhead of the army and around 40 cannons for a little over 10.000 men.\nThe battle started with an artillery duel which was swiftly won by the French. The rain slowed down the advance of the League's main forces. The attack from the Milanese knights halted the swiss formation while the stradioti instead looted the baggage train. The rest of the army was able to cross the river while others deserted the charge due to the unfavourable terrain which lead to the Italian retreat. In just an hour, the French army lost around 1000 men and the baggage train, which had around 300.000 ducats of valuables in it, while the Italians lost around 3000 to 4000 men including many commanders."

 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.400.D: "Following the Battle of Marignano in 1515, a period of peace had been established in Europe, which, however, slowly fell apart by the beginning of 1518. Since his election to the papal throne, Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] was intent on continuing the Italian policy of the Church initiated by Julius II but in opposing ways. \nThe greatest challenge for his pontificate opened with the death of Maximilian of Habsburg in 1519 and the possible rise of the latter's grandson, [SPA.Monarch.GetName], already Burgundian Duke of the Netherlands since 1506 and King of Spain since 1516. Opposing him, presenting himself as an alternative, was [FRA.Monarch.GetName] of France, perhaps the most powerful man in Europe after the peace imposed on the Habsburgs and the Pope himself. Since the former owned Naples and the latter Milan, the election of the Emperor also became a decisive game for Italy. It was clear to Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] that whoever won would drive the other out of the peninsula and break the balance imposed by the peace of Noyon and Brussels. Control of imperial Italy, and in particular Lombardy, was, for [SPA.Monarch.GetName]' chancellor, the Italian Mercurino Arborio di Gattinara, the 'keystone' to universal monarchy, as it could link the various possessions of Flanders, Spain, Austria and, in the event, Germany.

The viceroy himself ordered that the synagogue be built in another place. The reason for this provision is to be found in the fact that the Savocese Jews, in officiating their rites, sang hymns in such a loud voice as to disturb the civil, judicial and liturgical activities of the Christians that took place a few steps from there. The confiscated synagogue was sold to a local Christian citizen, a certain Fulippu Sturiali who had to pay his fellow Jews a sum equal to ¼ of the value of the property and "deliver or sell" a land or a building on which said Jews could have built or transfer their synagogue.

Each Jewish woman had a deliberative body represented by the regional council, which in turn elected the proti (which formed the executive body) and the tax committee (which divided the burden of donations to be paid to the treasury among the families). Other roles were exercised by the shochet (slaughterhouse attendant), the mohel (the one who performed the circumcision) and the shammashim (who took care of the synagogue)."

 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.6.T: "Jewish community of Naples"
 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.6.D: "In the annals of Naples and its environs, the earliest certain signs of Jewish habitation harken back to the first age of our era. In Pompeii, a metropolis of no small renown for its harbor, scrawlings and engravings upon walls do attest to the existence of a Jewish community.\n\nIn the year 1159 Benjamin of Tudela, a renowned traveler, visited the great city and reported the presence of a thriving community of the Jewish faith. Five hundred families called it home, a number surpassed only by the grand community of Salerno, which boasted six hundred families. This community's longevity was a testament to their steadfastness and resilience, for they had maintained their settlement from Antiquity through the centuries of the High Middle Ages.\n\nIn the ancient tomes of lore, evidence of their presence within the great city could be discovered. In the tenth age, they dwelt within a vicus judaeorum, and by the year of our Lord 1097, a grand synagogue hebraeorum had been erected. But it was a most propitious moment in the year 1153 that truly spoke to the prosperity of the Neapolitan community. In the year of grace twelve hundred and thirty-one, the great king Federico of the Swabian folk gathered in the Book of Augustus (the Melfitan Laws) many decrees of old, from the Normans and his own kin, that named the Jews as thralls of his treasury, and freed them from the thraldom of the local lords and the clergy, and showed a friendly mind to all the Jews in his realm of Sicily: for he took them under his kingly shield and gave them equal rights with the Gentiles in matters of justice and strife; and he ordered the craft of money-lending, setting a limit of interest that should not pass ten in the hundred.\n\nBut when the days of Federico the Second and his heirs waned, the mood of the world changed. From the year twelve hundred and eighty-eight, and most of all from twelve hundred and ninety to twelve hundred and ninety-four, a great “storm” broke upon the Jews, wrought by the cunning words of the Black Friars who had honed their speech against them for many years, and which grew yet fiercer with the coming of Charles the Lame after Charles of Anjou."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.1.T: "Albrecht Durer"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.1.D: "Albrecht Dürer was a painter, printmaker, and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Dürer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. He made his mark in many areas of art, but especially in his woodcuts of religious scenes, landscape paintings, and proportionality in art. He was later commemorated by the Lutheran church, and was seen as one of the foremost artists of the Northern Renaissance."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.1.OPT1: "A true Renaissance man."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.2.T: "Jewish Presence in the Empire"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.2.D: "While Jews were granted limited protection by Emperors during the 14th century, the Hussite Wars and other religious conflicts in the 15th signaled a renewed persecution of Jews throughout the Empire. Medieval attitudes that ascribed all kinds of evils to the Jewish communities intensified in many places in Germany. At the same time, they remain vital contributors to local economies. Additionally, the spread of the Renaissance and humanism has given rise to new attitudes of tolerance."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.2.OPT1: "“Tolerance” might be worth it, if only for the money these. people bring"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.2.OPT2: "Who actually thinks we can trust them? Evict them and. confiscate their wealth!"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.2.OPT3: "Tolerance is the way of the future, let us take Jewish refugees in!"

	FEE_HRE_Minors.3.T: "The Diet of Worms"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.3.D: "While, initially, the preachings of Martin Luther were seen as just another local heresy to be condemned and uprooted, the explosion of pamphlets, proselytes, and protests have made the Protestant movement too large to ignore. Hoping to head off the controversy, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to convene an unofficial Diet, essentially putting Luther on trial for his beliefs. Despite his delay tactics, Luther eventually was forced to definitively say whether he would recant his beliefs or not. Famously, he responded\nwith “I neither can nor will retract anything; for it cannot be either safe or honest for a Christian to speak against his conscience. Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise; God help me! Amen”"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.3.OPT1: "He must be condemned as a heretic."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.3.OPT2: "Condemning him now is too risky - let him go."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.4.T: "Johannes Gutenberg"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.4.D: "A goldsmith, tinkerer, and inventor, Gutenberg made his mark on Western civilization by being the first to introduce the movable type printing press to Europe. Arguably the most important invention in history prior to the steam engine, the printing press single-handedly reshaped European society."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.4.OPT1: "This man must be our advisor."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.5.T: "The Depression of the 16th Century"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.5.D: "As Western Europe begins to bring wealth from the New World and open up maritime trade to the Orient, the traditional wealth of German states dried up and the states of the Empire entered a prolonged depression. The overland routes between Italy and Germany fell into disuse and the trade in north Germany fell further and further behind that of the Atlantic powers. Even the great house of the Fuggers, making loans on the basis of ongoing German prosperity, found themselves overstretched and collapsed into bankruptcy. People began to leave the onceprosperous German cities, many for the booming cities of the Low Countries. "
	FEE_HRE_Minors.5.OPT1: "We shall recover… eventually."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.6.T: "Martin Luther in Hiding"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.6.D: "Despite Luther's ringing defense of his faith in the Bible, the Diet of Worms proclaimed him a heretic. A price was laid on his head, giving any Imperial citizen free license to kill Luther. Elector [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, was not about to let this happen. Determined to save the fledgling Reformation while he/she still could, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had him “ambushed” by masked men and spirited away to one of his castles, where no one would find him.\nLuther used the time well, translating the Bible into German directly from the original Greek, writing hymns, and coining the five key tenets of the Reformation: Sola Scriptura, Sola Gratia, Sola Fide, Solus Christus, and Soli Deo Gloria. These five “Sola's” would become the rallying cry of the reformation all over Europe."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.6.OPT1: "God has willed it."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.6.OPT2: "Protect him!"

	FEE_HRE_Minors.7.T: "The Question of the Imperial Navy"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.7.D: "The Holy Roman Empire has always been defined by two things: its decentralization and independence of princes, and its focus on internal, mainly German, affairs. As such, the Empire has never had the need or the resources to develop an Imperial Navy.\nHowever, when [Root.GetName] began to invest its own meager resources into a competitive navy, the Emperor did not take long to take note of the development. Now, a diplomat from the Emperor's court has arrived in [Root.GetName] with an interesting proposal.\nPointing out the obvious truth, the Imperial diplomat argued that, since we have invested into expensive warships, our defensive capabilities on land may be sadly lacking in comparison to our neighbors. At the same time, the Emperor has a strong land army but little in the way of a navy. If we were to join forces with the Emperor and place our navy at his disposal should he need it, he would be more than willing to protect us on land in return."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.7.OPT1: "A splendid proposition."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.7.OPT2: "We are better off alone."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.8.T: "Industrialization in the Rhineland"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.8.D: "While Britain may have led the way in its abundance of coal, the densely-populated and resource-rich ground of the Rhineland is in an excellent position to compete. And compete we must. Our small size relative to the great European powers means we must find a niche in the emerging international market or become merely a commodity ourselves to be taken, traded, and sold to the highest bidder. The reforms necessary to bring about needed change, and the speed at which they must be done, may make some people uncomfortable, however."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.8.OPT1: "Wealth is the only way by which small nations can have. influence"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.8.OPT2: "We must lead the way in human advancement; only then may. we achieve the respect of our neighbors"

 FEE_Italy_Events.1.T: "The Wars of Italy"
 FEE_Italy_Events.1.D: "The Italian peninsula of the Middle Ages was divided between the fragmented north, split into numerous fiefs and city-states under the nominal sovereignty of the Holy Roman Emperor, the Kingdoms of Sicily and Naples in the south, and the Papal State that had jurisdiction over parts of central Italy. The fourteenth century was a period of consolidation for the biggest powers of Italy, especially for Milan, Venice, Florence, and the Pope, who expanded their dominions over the smaller cities. The friction that arose from these expansions continued into the next century and culminated with the Lombard Wars between Milan and Venice. Following the signing of the Peace of Lodi in 1454, a balance emerged between the five regional powers: the Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Venice, the Papal State, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Republic of Florence. A mutual defence pact, the Italian League, was formed between them and the four decades that followed were characterized by diplomatic and military balance, overseen by Lorenzo de' Medici. Conflicts were kept small and regionalized, while the Renaissance was flourishing in all Italian centers of culture. This balance was however broken in the last decade of the century, following the death of the Florentine statesman. The spark for the First Italian War was the dynastic succession of the duchy of Milan. \nThe many wars that shaped the Italian peninsula from 1494 on saw the introduction of many significant advances in military technology and tactics, including field artillery, muskets, and combined tactics."

While the first part of the wars saw the prevalence of Swiss mercenaries and lansquenets, groups with firearms established themselves from 16th century. \n\nIn 1503, a skirmish between French and Spanish forces represented the first demonstration of the usefulness of arquebuses in battle. The Spanish general Gonzalo de Codoba feigned a retreat, attracting a contingent of men-at-arms between two groups of his arquebusiers. As the French army found themselves among the shooters, volleys of bullets hit them hard in both flanks. Before the French could attack the vulnerable arquebusiers, a Spanish cavalry charge broke the French forces and forced them to retreat. While the French army was in rout, the Spanish enemies inflicted heavy losses on it. \n\nThe success of the use of firearms in the Italian wars led Niccolò Machiavelli, often described as an enemy of the use of the arquebuses, to write in his treatise On the art of war that all citizens of a city should know how to shoot with a pistol."
 FEE_Italy_Events.2.OPT1: "Refine the Musketeers!"

 FEE_Italy_Events.3.T: "Cavalry, to Charge!"
 FEE_Italy_Events.3.D: "Heavy cavalry - the latest evolution of medieval armored knights - remained the protagonist in the battlefields of the Italian wars. The French gendarmes generally proved to be the most effective against the horse troops of the other states, mainly because of the excellent horses in their possession. The Spaniards used a type of cavalry called Jinete in their sorties."
 FEE_Italy_Events.3.OPT1: "To Charge!"

 FEE_Italy_Events.4.T: "Artillery must be prefectioned"
 FEE_Italy_Events.4.D: "The Italian wars saw artillery, especially field artillery, take on an indispensable role in any first-rate army. Charles VIII, during his invasion of Italy, brought with him a truly mobile siege procession, consisting of culverins and bombards mounted on wheeled trolleys, which could be deployed against an enemy fortress immediately upon arrival. The French siege arsenal brought with it several technological innovations. Charles's army used horses to pull cannons rather than the oxen typically used up to that time. Furthermore, French cannons, forged in the same methods used to produce bronze bells, boasted a previously unknown lightness and mobility. The most important improvement of the French however was the creation of iron cannonballs. Before the Italian wars, artillery fired stone balls that often shattered upon impact. The invention of water mills allowed the operation of furnaces with a temperature sufficient to melt the iron in order to make cannon balls. With this technology, Charles's army could conquer, within a few hours, walls and castles that had previously resisted sieges for months or even years. \n\nThe armies of the Italian wars were led by a great variety of commanders, from mercenaries to noble leaders up to the king himself."
 FEE_Italy_Events.4.OPT1: "Tear them down!"

 FEE_Italy_Events.5.T: "We will be safe behind our Forts"
 FEE_Italy_Events.5.D: "Most of the fighting that took place during the Italian wars took place during the sieges. That of the first descent of Charles VIII in Italy is traditionally considered the initial date of the development of the fortification to the modern, which will lead to the birth of increasingly complex fortified systems during the subsequent invasions. The army of Charles VIII in fact had a modern artillery in front of which many antiquated medieval castles had to succumb. These systems will soon spread throughout Europe, initially by Italian engineers."
 FEE_Italy_Events.5.OPT1: "They won't fall"

FEE_Italy_Events.6.T: "Diplomatic Solutions"
FEE_Italy_Events.6.D: "Though the Italian wars raged and most states were caught in the conflict in some capacity, some managed to keep out of the conflict. Though small in size and numbers, the miniscule states and princedoms of the Italian peninsula managed to keep out of the wars and hold their fragile independence intact. This set a precedent in the Italian cities like Monaco and San Marino, where the latter got involved in the Napoleonic Wars. \nNapoleon promised to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic even so far as offering to extend its territory according to its needs. While grateful for the former, the offer of territorial expansion was politely declined by San Marino and the thunders of war was ultimately never brought upon San Marino."

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.2.D: "Situated perfectly at the confluence of the Baltic Sea, English Channel, and Rhine River trade routes, Amsterdam grew in importance and influence throughout the 15th century. As the Hanseatic League to the east began to lose coherence, merchants from Amsterdam increasingly filled the vacuum in the Baltic Sea. The growing population of the Lowlands also led to an increased demand for grain from the Baltic shores, since land could no longer be reclaimed fast enough to keep up with demand for food. \nThe upshot of all this was that Amsterdam would become the primary port in Europe for the important and distribution of grain from the Baltic."

However, external forces gradually eroded the Frisian Freedom through military efforts or even outright buying off of local power brokers. By 1498, the Freedom was all but gone, and Imperial forces would occupy Frisia. \nIt wouldn't take long before this occupation and revocation of ancient freedoms, stemming from the time of Charlemagne himself, would be rejected by the population.

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.5.D: "During the Eighty Years' War, or Dutch Revolt, the many Spanish tercios of the Army of Flanders under Julian Romero, employed to purge the anti-Catholic heresy and bring the rebel provinces of Holland and Zeeland back into line were growing restless. They were weary of endless fighting with little to no rest, and frustrated at their lack of pay by the Spanish Crown. The troops had their pay delayed due to Spain's recent declaration of bankruptcy, leading to the bankers refusing to authorise payment until they had negotiated with Phillip II. This meant that the King had to send the physical money by sea, which was much more perilous. To make matters worse, 400,000 florins intended for the soldiers were seized by the English after the ships carrying them were forced to take refuge in English ports during a storm. This pushed the tercios too far. They decided to find their pay for themselves, as was a time old tradition, by sacking a major city. They chose the de facto capital of the Seventeen Provinces at the time, Antwerp, from which to take what they were owed. This was due to the treachery of the Spanish commander of Antwerp Citadel, Sancho d'Avila. He attempted to convince the commander of the garrison of German mercenaries to deliver the city into Spanish hands. This, however, had the opposite effect. The Germans began to improvise defences against the Spaniards and a day before the mutinying tercios arrived, 6,000 Walloon mercenaries were let into the city to help defend it. This was not enough, unfortunately for the city and its citizens. The defences were overrun by the professionally trained soldiers and the Walloon troops not only failed to defend the city, but even fled or participated in the looting of Antwerp. The few remaining Germans and the civilians were massacred, some 7,000 lives lost."

 FEE_Mantua_Events.1.T: "Antonio di Puccio Pisano"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.1.D: "In the first half of the century a late Gothic taste prevailed as in the rest of the Lombardy area, with the fundamental stay of Pisanello as a court artist known above all for the splendid large frescoes, suspended between realism and the fantastic world and populated by countless figures, with bright colors and precise strokes."
 FEE_Mantua_Events.1.OPT1: "Show us your paintings!"

 FEE_Mantua_Events.2.T: "Leon Battista Alberti"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.2.D: "Italian architect, writer, mathematician, humanist, cryptographer, linguist, philosopher, musician and archaeologist; he is one of the most multifaceted artistic figures of the Renaissance. Alberti is part of the second generation of humanists (the one following Vergerio, Bruni, Bracciolini, Francesco Barbaro). A constant interest of him was the search for rules, theoretical or practical, capable of guiding the work of artists. In his works he mentioned some canons, for example: in the "De statue" he exposed the proportions of the human body, in the "De pictura" he provided the first definition of the scientific perspective and finally in the "De re aedificatoria", he described all the cases relating modern architecture, emphasizing the importance of the project and the different types of buildings according to their function."
 FEE_Mantua_Events.2.OPT1: "He will work on our temples!"

 FEE_Mantua_Events.3.T: "Chiesa di San Sebastiano"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.3.D: "The first Mantuan intervention concerned the church of San Sebastiano, a private chapel of the Gonzagas, begun in 1460. The building was the foundation for the Renaissance reflections on the Greek cross buildings: it is in fact divided into two floors, one of which is underground apsidal arms around a cubic body with a cross vault; the front arm is preceded by a portico, today with five openings. The upper part of the façade, divided by giant pilasters, is original of the Albertian project and recalls an elaboration of the classical temple, with a broken architrave, tympanum and a Syriac arch, testifying to the extreme freedom with which the architect arranged the elements. Perhaps the inspiration was a late antique work, such as the Orange Arch. The two connecting stairways that allow access to the portico are not part of the original project, but were added later. "
 FEE_Mantua_Events.3.OPT1: "We will fund the project"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.3.OPT2: "We cannot afford it now"

 FEE_Mantua_Events.4.T: "Basilica di Sant'Andrea"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.4.D: "The ancient lexicon was manipulated with equal ease in the Basilica of Sant'Andrea, despite, also in this case, the tampering with the original projects that occurred during construction, after the death of Alberti. The building was born to replace a shrine where a precious relic of the blood of Christ was venerated. Alberti changed the orientation of the church aligning it with the road axis that connected Palazzo Ducale to the Tea. The church has a Latin cross plan, with a single, large barrel vaulted nave with lacunars, on which side chapels with a rectangular base open up. The choice was also linked to specific ancient references, such as the Etruscan temple described by Vitruvius and the Basilica of Maxentius. In order to monumentally seal the entire area, particular importance was given to the façade, set as a triumphal arch with a single archway between walls, even more monumental than the previous example on the façade of the Malatesta Temple. Greater emphasis is then given by a second upper arch, beyond the tympanum, which marks the height of the nave and which, thanks to the internal opening, allows the lighting of the building. The atrium has a great thickness, as a filtering point between inside and outside, which also recurs in the layout of the internal chapels."

 FEE_Mantua_Events.5.T: "Scuola di Mantova"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.5.D: "Mantua was conquered by the Renaissance spirit from the middle of the 15th century, depending entirely on the Gonzaga dynasty, which made the city, despite the smallness of the territory and its relative importance on the European chessboard, one of the most beautiful courses in Europe. On a strictly sociological level, and unlike other Renaissance Italian centers of development, Mantua was at that time deeply linked to the reigning family: the sponsorship and commissions of the Gonzaga, however important they were, mainly aimed only at the interests of the prince. . Also, under these conditions, the artists and craftsmen solicited by the Gonzaga are totally dependent on the Mantuan court."

 FEE_Mantua_Events.8.T: "Celeste Galeria"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.8.D: "It was in the 15th century that the most important art collections were formed by the Princes of the Renaissance. Among the largest were the collections of the Popes, the Medici and the Gonzagas. Initially they were directed towards the testimonies of the classical world, and then sculptures, bronzes, coins and medals from the Greek and Roman times. But the Princes, who became patrons, began to commission works from contemporary artists. Inspiration of the Gonzagas were the Wunderkammer of the Princes of Bavaria. In particular, Isabella d'Este looked to this model by creating her own personal study that acquired international notoriety. The Gonzaga collections themselves became an example for the European courts, also for the proverbial intuition shown by the Gonzagas in the choice of the works of their contemporaries. Likewise, art collecting became an instrument of representation and communication in the subtle diplomatic game to which the small Mantuan state necessarily had to apply. The maximum splendor came during the government of the Dukes Vincenzo I Gonzaga and Ferdinando (son of Vincenzo I). By the will of the latter the works of art were inventoried, for the time an inventory prepared with avant-garde criteria, the usefulness of which turned out to be even greater because the diaspora of the works kept in the palaces of Mantua was about to begin. "

 FEE_Mantua_Events.9.T: "Condotte Militari"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.9.D: "The fortunes of the family were also linked to military conduct, inaugurated with Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, first marquis of Mantua, in 1410. Militating as a captain first under the flags of Venice and then of Milan, he expanded the borders of the Gonzaga state with the territories he received in exchange for their military services. The survival of the small state was strongly tied to its ability to offer military strength and expertise to major powers in exchange for protection."

 FEE_Mantua_Events.10.T: "Jew Community of Mantua"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.10.D: "The presence of Jews in Mantua is testified by the first certain documents, as far back as 1145. The Gonzagas encouraged Jewish immigration, also aimed at obtaining immediate economic interests from the Jewish bankers exercising through the feneratizi banks, the loan of money at interest. There were three main immigration flows, from Rome, Germany and Provence. At the end of the sixteenth century, one of the largest Italian Jewish communities of the time was created in Mantua: over 3,000 people, or 7% of the city's population. At the same time Jewish families carrying out the credit activity moved to the smaller centers governed by the Gonzagas; therefore, small communities with fenerative benches, synagogues and Jewish cemeteries arose in Ostiano (Cremona), Rivarolo Mantovano, Viadana, Pomponesco, Bozzolo, Castel Goffredo."
 FEE_Mantua_Events.10.OPT1: "We will pardon but control them"

 FEE_Mantua_Events.11.T: "Mantuan Ghetto"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.11.D: "In Mantua, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, a large Jewish community (over 3,000 people) had been created following a policy of religious tolerance pursued by the Gonzagas. In fact, the establishment of the ghetto was endured, not without resistance, by the Gonzagas in compliance with the provisions of Pope Paul IV contained in the Bull Cum nimis absurdum of 1555. 7% of the city population, 408 families, was forced to concentrate in the then districts of the Camel and the Griffin enclosed by doors that opened at dawn and closed at sunset. The ghettoisation coincided with the beginning of the decline of the Mantuan Jewish community parallel to that of the dominant Gonzaga family. "

In the first place, Ferrante would succeed with his wife at the helm of the Principality, thus allowing the king and in the future Ferrante himself, destined to the throne, to confiscate one of the most important fiefdoms of the kingdom in their own domains. Furthermore, the kinship link allowed the sovereign to strengthen his power of influence over the Orsini of Taranto."

 FEE_Naples_Events.9.T: "Congiura dei baroni"
 FEE_Naples_Events.9.D: "The resistance opposed by the barons to the modernization of the state pursued by the Aragonese in Naples. The king [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Naples had aimed to dissolve the feudal particularism and make the royal power the sole lever of the life of the country. In this context, the clash with the barons inevitably arose around the big problem of an "organic reform of the state", the cornerstones of which were the reduction of baronial power, the development of economic life and the promotion of new entrepreneurs to the ruling class. Neapolitan merchants. An instrument of this policy was the fiscal reform, which entrusted new tasks to the municipal administrations (universities), encouraging them to escape, as far as possible, the feudal weight. And in truth it has been calculated that at that time in the Kingdom of Naples, out of 1550 inhabited centers, only a little more than 100 were assigned to the royal state property, that is, under the direct control of the king and the court, while all the others were controlled by the barons. This meant that the feudal power as a whole was the owner of the resources and finances of the kingdom and that the Aragonese court was in fact made subordinate to the baronial organization. It was therefore natural that the king favored in every way the numerical extension of the state-owned cities, removing them from the feudal weight and incorporating them into his own direct administration. But the undertaking was no small feat. The barons were organized into large, fairly branched dynasties, each of which alone controlled more lands than the king. The Orsini Del Balzo, for example, boasted of being able to travel from Taranto to Naples without ever leaving their possessions; the Sanseverinos, now opposed and now protected by the king, were owners of fiefs which from Calabria, through almost all of Basilicata, reached Salerno and lapped Naples; the Acquaviva, the Caldora, the Caracciolos, the Guevara and the Senerchia completed this small elite in power, which in fact surrounded the capital, suffocating the kingdom."
 FEE_Naples_Events.9.OPT1: "We will never meet their demands, the time of diplomacy is over!"

 FEE_Naples_Events.10.T: "Congiura dei baroni sedata"
 FEE_Naples_Events.10.D: "A first hard fight between the barons and King Ferrante had already occurred in the long war fought within the kingdom from 1459 to [GetYear]. The king had then obtained the help of many Italian captains, to whom had been added a contingent of 1000 infantry and 700 knights landed from the Adriatic overseas and led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu, the Albanian national hero in search of new lands for the his people dispersed by the Turks. The great losers of that war were Giovanni Antonio Orsini Del Balzo, the last prince of Taranto, who died in Altamura in [GetYear], perhaps suffocated by the king himself through the archpriest of that church, and Antonio Caldora, duke of Bari, who after having been captured in [GetYear] during the siege of Vasto was stripped of all possessions by the sovereign. The fact is that the Orsini del Balzo then lost the vast territory of the Principality of Taranto, which was confiscated by the court, until the Church, after not long, claimed its direct power over Altamura with greater force, thus providing the Del Balzo , feudal lords of the city, an ecclesiastical administration more free from respect for the King and more loyal and faithful to the baron, while the Caldora, after having lost all their territories with that defeat, distributed for the most part in Abruzzo, Molise, in Capitanata and in the land of Bari, they never got up again. In short, the war against the barons of 1459-[GetYear] had ended bitterly, but with a clear victory for the king. He had then been able to resume his policy with greater certainty, innovating in fiscal and feudal legislation, that is, mortifying the baronial prerogatives, extending the power of the court and the state, reorganizing the economic and commercial life of the kingdom. The state-owned cities grew, albeit to an inadequate extent, and the barons underwent the royal initiative for some years. "

 FEE_Naples_Events.11.D: "After years of careful diplomacy and agreements with the leader of the nobility like Orsini del Bazo, principe of Taranto and Antonio Caldora, duke of Bari, our good king [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to create a peaceful and prosperous ruling that will last for many years."

 FEE_Naples_Events.14.T: "Seconda Congiura dei Baroni"
 FEE_Naples_Events.14.D: "The conspiracy was hatched in 1485 by the prince of Salerno Antonello Sanseverino. The latter, advised by Antonello Petrucci, Francesco Coppola and Luigi Gesualdo da Caggiano, gathered around him many feudal families of lords and barons of the kingdom of the Guelph faction in favor of the Angevins, including the Caracciolo, princes of Melfi, the Gesualdo , marquises of Caggiano, the Del Balzo, princes of Altamura and dukes of Andria and Venosa, the Guevara, counts of Apice and Ariano, the Senerchia, counts of Rapone and Sant'Andrea, the aforementioned Caldora and the Sienese barons. The barons who had gathered in Melfi, while sharing the concerns expressed to them by Guevara, did not feel like taking immediate and irrevocable action against Alfonso: they did not believe it was possible at that moment to solicit the intervention of the pope or of the new suitors. Moreover, the memory of the bitter defeat suffered in 1464 still burned. But they did not even want the proposal to fall completely on deaf ears, and they entrusted Girolamo Sanseverino, prince of Bisignano and count of Tricarico and Miglionico, with an exploratory task, to verify at least the possible alliances, seek the consent of the other barons absent from the banquet of Melfi, and possibly attempt the ways of a negotiation with the king. Girolamo Sanseverino, to carry out this exploratory assignment, met in Naples with Petrucci and with Coppola, with the aim of testing the intentions of the court environments and measuring any subsequent steps on them. Obtained from them an interlocutory but not negative answer, a real summit of the Sanseverinos was immediately held in Diano, that is, in the very heart of their feudal possessions, between the Calabria, Basilicata and Salerno. The five most important exponents of this family took part, namely, in addition to Prince Girolamo, Antonello Sanseverino, prince of Salerno, Giovanna Sanseverino, widow of the count of Sanseverino, grandmother of Antonello and aunt of Girolamo, her son Barnaba, count of Lauria, and his other nephew Giovanni, count of Tursi. Meanwhile the Coppola was moving on another side. He had personally gone to King Ferrante to inform him of the growing discontent he had encountered among the barons and declared himself willing to act as an intermediary between them and the court, to watch from within the machination in progress and to turn it in favor of the monarchy. He thus entered with conviction in the mechanism of the conspiracy, also dragging the hesitant royal secretary Antonello Petrucci and his sons into it. In Coppola's intentions, the choice of this ambivalent position should have allowed him to move more easily and with greater personal advantage: on the one hand, in the capacity of the king's envoy, he could have met the barons without making the sovereign suspicious, and on the other he would have deserved the trust of the always suspicious barons, thus mortgaging a prominent place next to them in the event that, once the path of the agreement with the sovereign became impracticable, it was decided to really dethrone the $DYNASTY$ dynasty."
 FEE_Naples_Events.14.OPT1: "We will meet again, on the battlefield."

 FEE_Naples_Events.15.T: "The Barons have been defeated"
 FEE_Naples_Events.15.D: "But things turned out differently and the precautions and intentions of Coppola and Petrucci were completely nullified. King [Root.Monarch.GetName] would have defeated everyone in skill and cynicism. He began by willingly agreeing to Coppola's proposal; he began to treat him since then as a real agent in his service who infiltrated the conspiracy on his behalf. Using it for this purpose, he never ceased to reward him with positions and honors of great prestige. But this did not mean that he entrusted all the destinies of the dynasty to Coppola or renounced his own initiative, which he elaborated and pursued with determination, aided by his son Alfonso. In short, in this intricate affair, Coppola together with Petrucci certainly acted with great ruthlessness, and ended up, together with Petrucci and his two sons, to fall victim to the death trap that he himself had contributed to hatch and to trigger. But it should also be noted that all the characters, including the king, faced the risks of this game by playing it each on more than one table. \nThe plan envisaged by the conspirators was the following: the barons of the territories closest to the capital would have prevented the king from crossing them, thus interrupting the communications of Naples with the rest of the country. Once the capital was isolated, the pope and other reinforcements would be allowed to penetrate the territory of the kingdom on the border between the Papal State and the Abruzzi. In this, the pope would have availed himself of the help of John II of Lorraine, in the name of the old Angevin aspirations for Naples, and of Roberto Sanseverino, the first captain of Italy, who would have acted on behalf of the Republic of Venice, but also for account of his Neapolitan family members. The definitive conclusion of this movement occurred in [GetYear] in the Castel of [Root.Capital.GetName]. In the hall of the barons, the last exponents of the conspiracy against the Aragonese court were arrested and killed. It was [Root.Monarch.GetName] himself who invited the barons into the hall, with the excuse of celebrating the wedding of his niece. In reality this was a trap: the barons were arrested and put to death."

 FEE_Naples_Events.17.D: "Tamed the internal pitfalls, Ladislao soon turned his attention outside the borders of his kingdom. It was in these years that the dream of building a great state reality that included the entire Italian peninsula, unified under the crown of Naples and the insignia of the Durazzo was born in him. The idea of a Kingdom of Italy that precedes the Risorgimento enterprise by more than four hundred years and to which Ladislao will dedicate all his efforts during his short life. In the years to come, in fact, he would take advantage of the crisis situation in which the composite Italian political reality was pouring to considerably expand his kingdom and his power above all to the detriment of the papal dominions, appropriating and disposing of many of the papal territories as he pleased. \nShould we reclaim the dream of Ladislao and focus on the creation of an Italian state?"

 FEE_Naples_Events.19.D: "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo was the first viceroy of Naples to effectively govern the kingdom on behalf of the Spanish crown. While issuing grand construction projects and modernizing the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government. \nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."

 FEE_Naples_Events.20.T: "The Construction Projects of Pedro Alvarez de Toledo"
 FEE_Naples_Events.20.D: "In addition to reforming the society of the Kingdom of Naples, Viceroy Pedro Alvarez de Toledo commissioned grand construction projects in the city of Naples itself. The old walls were expanded and new ones were built along the seafront. Fortresses, shipyards and barracks were modernised and expanded. He also commissioned a new palace for the Viceroy, which was then surrounded by buildings in square-grid streets. The Spanish Quarter, as it was called, was the first of its kind in Europe, and is still one of the most distinct areas of Naples. The express goal was to make Naples invulnerable, but it also had the side effect of making it the second largest city in Europe at the time. By his death in 1552, the legacy of the harsh ruler as a city-builder was more than secure, and Naples would continue to be a center of southern European power for centuries."

 FEE_Naples_Events.21.D: "The cave that would become the Fontanelle cemetery had for hundreds of years been used as a charnel house for old remains, which had been moved from graveyards in Naples to make space for citizens insisting on being interred near their churches. In the late 17th century, however, a series of floods caused remains to be washed from the cave into the streets of Naples. The grisly sight of skulls grinning up at them and bones resting in their gutters made the citizens realise that something had to be done to accommodate the ever-growing population."

The ancient building had been renovated and repurposed multiple times, from a monastery in the 8th century to a plague hospital in the 17th, before it found a new purpose as a poor house. While it could never house all of the estimated 1, destitute people in the city at the time, it was the first in a long tradition of hospices for the poor in Naples."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.17.D: "It has been a geopolitical constant of Europe that France, with its huge population, fertile soil, and absolutist rule has been the most powerful nation in Western Europe, if not all of the European continent. \nWith the weakening of the Holy Roman Emperor, long the counterweight to French ambitious, by religious wars, and even rumors of a Franco-Ottoman alliance, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided that it is high time the powers of western Europe formalize their intention to contain France. Accordingly, all nations with an interest in doing so shall receive invitations to meet in the Hague and form a Grand Alliance against the French."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.18.T: "Rembrandt"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.18.D: "Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, commonly known simply as Rembrandt, was a Dutch painter, printmaker, and draughtsman from Leiden. An innovator in all three distinct art media, he is widely considered one of the greatest artists in history and single-handedly embodied the Dutch Golden Age of the arts. He became famous for his intimate and brooding self-portraits, prints of scenes from the Bible, and his pioneering work in the technique of etching. \nIn opposition to the prevailing Baroque style of the age, and to the art styles which preceded them, Rembrandt's paintings, like those of other Dutch masters, presented ordinary life scenes as objects of high art. This “democratization” of art showed such empathy for ordinary human life that he was called “one of the great prophets of civilization."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.18.OPT1: "A true master of the arts!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.19.T: "Huguenot Refugees"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.19.D: "The relatively tolerant order established in France after the French Wars of Religion is rapidly deteriorating. The rise of absolutism in our larger neighbor has led to the revocation of legal protections for the French minority of Protestants known as Huguenots. In addition, the continued actions of the Inquisition in Spain and religious conflicts ongoing in Germany have made our Republic into an island of peace and stability. While constant conflict in Europe results in rampant poverty, in Amsterdam there are always jobs! \nNaturally, these people of all faiths wish to seek a better life in our trading cities."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.21.T: "Lack of Investment in Manufacturing "
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.21.D: "Our dominance of the global trade networks has brought unprecedented wealth to our shores. Even as other nations begin to copy our techniques for trade and ship-building, we ourselves have become complacent. Many merchants seem content to continue accruing profit from existing trade routes, heedless of the looming competition, while our investors find foreign opportunities more lucrative than our own nation swamped in excess capital. \nOur emphasis on trade has led us this far, but an investment into our nations manufacturing capacity is critical if we are to avoid being left behind by other nations. Alternatively, some suggest that we could pawn our gains from trade back into the finances markets which so helped us before, that we may create a self-reinforcing cycle of financial growth without additional spending or investment."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.21.OPT1: "The world is changing, and industry is the future"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.21.OPT2: "The investment of capital is core to a nation's success"

 FEE_Ottoman_Events.3.D: "Murad II had ruled the Ottoman Empire for more than twenty years, facing insurrection and disloyalty whilecontinuing the Empire's expansion, before retiring in favor of his son Mehmet in late 1444. \nThe transition was unclear however, as the 12-year old Mehmet made famous when calling his father to lead the Turkish armies at the battle of Varna: \"If you are the Sultan, come and lead your armies. If I am the Sultan, I command you to come and lead my armies.\" Murad led the armies and won a great victory over the Christian coalition on November 10th 1444, ending the Crusade of Varna.\n\nMurad was not free to return to retirement, however. While the young Sultan attempted to establish his authority, Çandarli Halil Pasha, grand vizier and true governor of the empire, opposed him. The grand vizier found Mehmed too strongly influenced by his teacher, who Çandarli considered a rival.\nÇandarli arranged for dissent among the janissaries, who threatened with revolt unless Murad were to return to the throne. Still mostly a child, Mehmet acquiesced and Murad returned to once again rule the empire.\nHe passed away five years later, and Mehmet could once again take the throne, this time unopposed. Two days after Mehmet's greatest achievement, the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Sultan had Çandarli put to death."

 FEE_Persia_Events.1.D: "The Qizilbash were a conglomeration of Turkoman tribes from Asia Minor who helped Shah Ismail conquer Persia and champion their Shiite faith as the head of the Safavid dynasty. While they revered Ismail as a saint, the fact that the unruly clans were the foundation of Persian power would lead to more than a century of internal struggles."

 FEE_Persia_Events.2.T: "The Qizilbash Lend Their Support"
 FEE_Persia_Events.2.D: "The rise of Persia was bought with the blood of Qizilbash warriors. With our armies marching to take back the land that is rightfully ours, a council of chieftains have sent us an additional contingent of soldiers."

They became valued soldiers and royal servants, but it was not until Shah Abbas the Great that they became a political force of their own, loyal only to the Shah. Abbas expanded their army regiments and ensured them positions in the royal administration, and soon many of them were among Persia's highest ranking officers and administrators.

While the Turkoman tribes were still an important part of Persia, their leaders no longer ruled as independent chieftains, and they would never again get to choose their Shah. Although Persia continued to struggle with rebellions, these would not be led by chieftains, but by self-styled kings."
 FEE_Persia_Events.7.OPT1: "No-one will ever hold Persia hostage again!"

 FEE_Persia_Events.8.T: "Decline of the Qizilbash"
 FEE_Persia_Events.8.D: "After centuries of infighting, the Qizilbash were overtaken by centralisation and modern statesmanship.

With their leaders in our hands, we have brought an end to the uprising. Due to scale of the damage suffered by the Nobility, the lands of the Cossacks are going to be confiscated in favour of them. As for Nalyvaiko and the rest of the leader, their punishment will be severe and cruel."

 FEE_PLC_Cossack_Revolts_Events.22.D: "Well-respected among his friends and subordinates, Registered Cossack Bohdan Khmelnytsky, after receiving no support from the Polish officials in his land dispute against Daniel Czaplinski who, on behalf of Magnate Aleksander Koniecpolski, had tried to force him off the land by committing raids to Subotiv, his residence, is suspiciously traveling from one Cossack regiment to another and thus seems to be plotting another Cossack revolt."

 FEE_Poland_Events.1.T: "The Union of Brest"
 FEE_Poland_Events.1.D: "The shattering of the unity of Latin Christendom by the Reformation is in full swing. Even among those monarchs that have stayed true to the Catholic faith, the division in Christendom ushered in a period of great adjustment. In Eastern Europe, the division between Catholic and Orthodox meant a long tradition of believers who officially considered each other heretics living side-by-side. More than anywhere else, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has embraced fundamental ideas of religious tolerance and personal freedom. To further these ideals in a time of unrest, King [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proposed a Treaty of Union between Catholic and Orthodox. This Union would effectively outflank Protestantism by the acceptance of Papal authority by the entrenched Orthodox clergy in return for a guarantee of freedom to practice Orthodox rituals. However, if we do this, many in our realm who now practice Catholicism for political gain may revert to their old faith, making the Orthodox more influential than previously thought..."
 FEE_Poland_Events.1.OPT1: "Together, as one!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.1.OPT2: "We cannot compromise with heretics!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.9.T: "The Statutes of Nieszawa"
 FEE_Poland_Events.9.D: "Przywilej cerekwicko-nieszawski were laws enacted in Poland in 1454, that gave the nobles, the szlachta, several priveliges and concessions. The laws stated that the king required the approval of the nobles when issuing new laws, levying forces or introducing new taxes. \nThe reason king Casimir IV Jagiellon agreed to this was the need for support in the Thirteen Years War against the Teutonic Order. While the war led towards the absorption of the Teutonic lands into Poland, the Statutes of Nieszawa laid the groundwork for the coming conflicts between the king and the szlachta."
 FEE_Poland_Events.9.OPT1: "Accept the conventions."
 FEE_Poland_Events.9.OPT2: "Refuse to sign and defy the Magnates!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.10.T: "Statutes of Piotrokow"
 FEE_Poland_Events.10.D: "Konstytucje piotrkowskie was a collection of laws passed in 1496 under king John I Olbracht who, in the tradition of his forebears, made concessions to the szlachta in exchange for their support in war. The szlachta were guaranteed certain rights, including relief from specific taxes and exclusive access to some Church offices. \nThe laws also affected the situation of peasants in the country, restricting them to their lands. After 1496, only one peasant from each village could leave per year, and only one person from a given peasant family was allowed to move to the growing towns. City burghers were also restricted from holding royal and national offices. \nFinally, the statues emphasised the rivers of Poland, removing all internal tariffs on waterways."
 FEE_Poland_Events.10.OPT1: "Enact as the szlactha require."
 FEE_Poland_Events.10.OPT2: "The king will not be forced!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.11.T: "Union of Vilnius"
 FEE_Poland_Events.11.D: "Unia krakowsko-wileñska was an attempt at taking a major step in the unification of Poland and Lithuania. It was signed by both Polish and Lithuanian nobles in 1499, and described two equal states in perpetual alliance. The countries would select their own leaders with the approval of the other, but would always support each other in armed conflicts. \nHowever, the Union did not last long in that state. Polish nobles soon began to protest it, mainly because it emphasised Lithuania as much as Poland. The reasoning they gave however, was that it was based on an old union of 1413, which they claimed there was no evidence for."
 FEE_Poland_Events.11.OPT1: "Our countries should cooperate."
 FEE_Poland_Events.11.OPT2: "Our countries are better off as just friends."

 FEE_Poland_Events.12.T: "The Privilege of Mielnik"
 FEE_Poland_Events.12.D: "The Przywilej mielnicki was an act passed by king Alexander Jagiellon in 1501, that expanded the powers of the magnates and the Sejm, to the point where it practically introduced a republican form of government. The king lost many rights, and was effectively demoted to the head of the Sejm, which held all real power. \nHowever, after being elected as head of the Sejm, the king never confirmed the priveliges, and it gradually became apparent that the struggle between the king and the greater Sejm harmed the nobles more than the new status quo helped them. \nIn 1504, the legal change was rejected by the Sejm, and while the struggle between the nobles and the king would continue for a long time, this battle had ended in Alexander's favor."
 FEE_Poland_Events.12.OPT1: "Grant the privilege."
 FEE_Poland_Events.12.OPT2: "Reject these outrageous demands!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.13.T: "The Union of Mielnik"
 FEE_Poland_Events.13.D: "The Unia mielnicka was one of the first attempts to unite Poland and Lithuania into a single state. Previously the two countries had co-existed in personal union through the king, but the Union of Mielnik would unite them into a single entity. The suggestion of the union was not well-received in Lithuania, as Polish magnates were attempting to force Polish culture and traditions onto the other country, and nobles there led a revolt against the Poles. In the end, the union was neither ratified by the Lithuanian Seimas or the Polish Sejm, and the countries remained separate in personal union for nearly seventy years more before they were finally united. "
 FEE_Poland_Events.13.OPT1: "Unite our nations under Poland. (This will cause massive revolts among the Lithuanians.)"
 FEE_Poland_Events.13.OPT2: "Don't force anyone to sign this."

 FEE_Poland_Events.14.T: "Lithuanians Revolt Against the Union"
 FEE_Poland_Events.14.D: "After the introduction of the Union of Mielnik, Lithuanian nobles have banded together in massive numbers to rise up against their Polish counterparts. Through the union, magnates have insisted on instituting Polish language in education and bureaucracy, as well as rule by Polish traditions. Now the Lithuanians have decided to fight back with arms."
 FEE_Poland_Events.14.OPT1: "You were warned."

 FEE_Poland_Events.15.T: "1504 Reforms Passed Before the King"
 FEE_Poland_Events.15.D: "In 1504, the Sejm piotrowski passed measures to restrict the king's control over the national treasury, effectively placing the Sejm in control of state funds. \nThe Sejm did not get the measures passed without negotiation, however. Nobles were from now on forbidden from holding more than a single official administrative post. In addition, Polish magnates had to return much land that had previously been seized from the king, thereby compensating somewhat for the financial authority the king lost."
 FEE_Poland_Events.15.OPT1: "You lose some, you... win some?"

 FEE_Poland_Events.16.T: "Nothing New Without the Common Consent"
 FEE_Poland_Events.16.D: "Nihil novi nisi commune consensu was an act adopted by the Sejm in 1505 at Radom. It forbade the king to issue laws without the consent of the nobility. This consent would be given through the Senat and the Chamber of Deputies. \nThe only exceptions were laws governing royal cities, crown lands, mines, fiefdoms, royal peasants, and Jews. These exceptions can be traced by the meaning of the law's name in Polish, \"Nothing About Us Without Us.\""
 FEE_Poland_Events.16.OPT1: "The nobles can be of great aid."
 FEE_Poland_Events.16.OPT2: "This is too far! No more power to the nobles!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.17.T: "The Privilege of Torun"
 FEE_Poland_Events.17.D: "Przywilej toruñski was enacted in 1520 by the Polish king, granting the szlachta greater control over people living on their lands. Peasants were forced to pay serfdom to their masters, and prevented them from leaving their villages. This was a part of the greater trend of introducing serfdom in Eastern Europe at the time, as encouraging peasant settlers was no longer considered as necessary at it had been in earlier centuries. The Privilege defined Polish serfdom for the next century, before it gradually declined under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After nearly three centuries, the state's attitude would reverse into constitutional state protection for all peasants."
 FEE_Poland_Events.17.OPT1: "Serfdom is the way of the future!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.17.OPT2: "We can't give these predatory nobles more power."

 FEE_Poland_Events.18.T: "The Prussian Homage"
 FEE_Poland_Events.18.D: "Hołd pruski was the investment of the former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order as Duke of Prussia under the Polish crown. \nPoland required every new Grand Master of the Order to pay homage to the king, and a refusal to do so had resulted in lasting conflict between the Order and Poland, culminating in the Polish-Teutonic War. The war dragged on, and with renewed incursions of the Ottomans into Christian lands, the two states agreed to an armistice that would see the Teutonic Order secularised into a Polish dukedom. In the main square of Krakow, Albert publicly resigned as Grand Master before receiving the title Duke of Prussia from King Zygmunt the Old."
 FEE_Poland_Events.18.OPT1: "Establish Prussia as a royal fief."
 FEE_Poland_Events.18.OPT2: "The Order serves our purpose."

 FEE_Poland_Events.19.T: "Tumult of Danzig"
 FEE_Poland_Events.19.D: "The Tumult gdanski was a 1525 revolt by Lutheran burghers against the mayor of Danzig, Eberhard Ferber. The mayor was suspected of defrauding money from the city under the protection of the Crown Chancellor. As the revolt developed it took on a religious tone, and even though the mayor resigned, the refusal of the Chancellor to show the city accounts meant that riots continued. \nThe Protestant burghers closed Catholic churches and introduced their own preachers to replace pastors. As the city came under their control, the commoners demanded the removal of the city from the juridistiction of the local bishop, and a delegation sent to Martin Luther asked the priest to send teachers of the new faith. \nHowever, a year after the tumult started and two months after the burghers had seized complete control of the city, King Sigismund and the prince of Pommerania led an army into the city, putting down the revolt and beheading its leaders, restoring the old order to Danzig."
 FEE_Poland_Events.19.OPT1: "These people must be stopped at all costs!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.19.OPT2: "Live and let live."

 FEE_Poland_Events.20.T: "The Treaty of Vilnius"
 FEE_Poland_Events.20.D: "The Pakt wileñski was concluded between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Livonian Confederation in 1561, during the Livonian War. With the exception of the Free Imperial City of Riga, the Treaty brought all the Livonian states that were not occupied by Denmark or Sweden under the suzerainty of the Commonwealth. It also secularised the Livonian Order into the Duchy of Courland and Semigalla and the Duchy of Livonia. \nWhile the treaty finally lost Livonia its independence, in the eyes of the Polish state it rescued the Livonian lands from Russian aggression and inevitable conquest."
 FEE_Poland_Events.20.OPT1: "Incorporate Livonia, for their own good."
 FEE_Poland_Events.20.OPT2: "We don't have the capacity to administer those lands."

 FEE_Poland_Events.21.T: "Karnkowski's Statute"
 FEE_Poland_Events.21.D: "Statut karnkowskiego was a law enacted in 1570 by Stanislav Karnkowski, the bishop of Kujawy and Great Secretary of the Crown. The law gave the Polish king full authority over all matters of the sea, with the intention of improving Poland's naval capabilities in the Baltic Sea. The act led to extensive naval development in Danzig, but had no great effect beyond that due to the death of king Sigismund II August died, and the fact that his successor had little interest in competing for naval supremacy."
 FEE_Poland_Events.21.OPT1: "Expand the rights of the king."
 FEE_Poland_Events.21.OPT2: "We don't need this."

 FEE_Poland_Events.22.T: "The Prussian Homage"
 FEE_Poland_Events.22.D: "The Prussian Homage was the investment of the former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order as the duke of the secularised Ducal Prussia, a fief under the Polish Crown. \nThis fit well with Albert of Prussia's newfound Protestantism, as it allowed Prussia to no longer be a subject of the papacy. \nIt seems that our overlord has similarly decided that it is time we came properly under their wing as a secular duchy."
 FEE_Poland_Events.22.OPT1: "Humble before the Polish King."

 FEE_Poland_Events.23.T: "The Treaty of Vilnius"
 FEE_Poland_Events.23.D: "The Pakt wileñski was concluded between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Livonian Confederation in 1561, during the Livonian War. With the exception of the Free Imperial City of Riga, the Treaty brought all the Livonian states that were not occupied by Denmark or Sweden under the suzerainty of the Commonwealth. It also secularised the Livonian Order into the Duchy of Courland and Semigalla and the Duchy of Livonia. \nWhile the treaty finally lost Livonia its independence, in the eyes of the Polish state it rescued the Livonian lands from Russian aggression and inevitable conquest."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.1.T: "Luís de Camões"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.1.D: "The national poet of Portugal, Luís de Camões was a 16th century lyricist, so famous for his writing that Portuguese is sometimes referred to as \"the language of Camões\"\n\nFollowing a humanist education, he spent much of his life abroad, first serving willingly in Ceuta where he lost one eye in battle, before being forced to serve in the militia in Goa to avoid prison. He kept on writing as he travelled, and did not even stop as he became cheif warrant officer in Macau. His journeys were probably what inspired his most famous work, \"Os Lusíadas,\" an epic poem in the style of Homer about the Portuguese heroes of the age of exploration. The epic was mostly written in a grotto, and one story tells how de Camões was shipwrecked and swam ashore with one arm holding the poem above the water.\n\nWhile much of his work has been lost his genius was recognised in his time, and the day of his death, June 1th, is the national day of Portugal."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.1.OPT1: "A greater poet there never was and never will be again."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.T: "The Return of King Sebastian!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.D: "The line of Avis ended with the death of Sebastian the Child King on his crusade in Morocco, but the more than sixty years of Spanish rule that followed convinced many Portuguese that Sebastian was not truly dead, but would return one foggy day to free Portugal. This belief endured, and King Sebastian passed into legend as a sleeping hero, waiting for the day his country would need him again.\n\nOf course, a people expecting a savior and an evil oppressive state meant that there was no shortage of people trying to capitalise on the stories. There were no less than four impostors claiming to be Sebastian while Portugal was subject to Spain. \n\nNow a young man claiming to be Sebastian has arrived in Lisboa. What shall we do with him?"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.OPT1: "His name is Sebastian, that's good enough right now."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.OPT2: "Throw this impostor in the dungeons!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.3.T: "Spiceless!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.3.D: "With the final fall of Constantinople to the Turks came not only the end of Christian control of the Bosporus but also the expulsion of many Italian merchants hailing from a diverse and competitive array of Italian states; the only ones allowed to stay being the conniving Venetians. Ever mindful of profit over faith, those opportunistic snakes have cozied up with the Turks, abandoning all principle for their precious ducats.\n\nThe overland routes to India and the spice trade are all but cut, the lifeline that supplied us with exotic goods and spices. The Venetian monopoly may make them rich, but ultimately we are left spiceless and desperate for it, as is the rest of Europe. This situation is unacceptable!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.3.OPT1: "Well I guess we'll have to find another way to India!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.T: "The School of Sagres"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.D: "Nestled in the Southwest corner of Europe sandwiched between Spain and the Atlantic Ocean, the Portuguese people have always been natural seafarers. Lately, however, a prince in our court by the name of Dom Henrique de Viseu has put forth the idea that Portugal must secure a place on the seas in order to sail farther down the coast than any previous Europeans.\nDrawing on Portuguese tactics, cutting-edge Venetian advancements, and newly-discovered science, Henrique has proposed an unprecedented leap in royal patronage of navies. An organized school which not only teaches the sailors and admirals of tomorrow, but researches improved methods of cartography, ship design, and maritime combat. Additionally, he tells us that the royal patronage of the navy to an extent hitherto unseen in Europe will give Portugal the advantage she desperately needs in this age of discovery."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.OPT1: "Found Henry the Navigator's School!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.OPT2: "This isn't a matter for the crown."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.T: "A Rising Star"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.D: "During the bloody war of the Castilian Succession, one of our noblemen and soldiers proved a far more capable leader than anyone expected. Rallying our soldiers from almost \n\ncertain defeat, he turned what would have been annihilation into a victory. Now, his ambitions have grown along with his fame, and he has arrived at court seeking official promotion and new assignments abroad. "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.OPT1: "By all means, give him what he has deserved!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.OPT2: "That's great, kid. Don't get cocky."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.OPT3: "Such self-serving ambition is hardly worthy of our patronage!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.T: "The Shores of Africa"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.D: "Despite the inroads made by Portugal into the heart of the Moorish homeland, our control over the northern coast of Africa is being increasingly challenged by pirates and tribal raids. We have already dispatched Alfonso de Albuquerque to re-establish our control. Besides building an island fort in the area, however, he has struggled to find success. None other than Francisco de Almeida has approached us with a new and bold plan to dealing with these annoyances. A local emir has hinted that he might help us, provided we provide him with European gunpowder weaponry with which to do so. Of course, these weapons could later be used against us... \n\n"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.OPT1: "Almeida's plan is a good one!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.OPT2: "Arming our potential enemies is never wise..."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.7.T: "Emir Lends his Aid"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.7.D: "True to his word, the Emir contacted by Almeida has joined us in our efforts against the Moorish pirates!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.7.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.T: "Emir's Betrayal!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.D: "No sooner did the scoundrel Emir have our weaponry safely inside his castle than he turned them on the very ships that brought them to him! We should have known better than to trust a pirate..."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.OPT1: "We shall have his head!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.OPT2: "We must back down... for now."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.T: "To Africa!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.D: "Once again, Almeida has approached us with a proposal. While our ships are capable of getting to India with only minor difficulty, he says, it would be much easier for our merchants and sailors if we were to explore the eastern shores of Africa and set up supply depots for ships to stop at. Additionally, trade with the Africans themselves may prove of no small profit! Almeida even claims to have already identified three promising locations for Portuguese trading posts."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.OPT1: "A splendid idea! Spare no expense and send out an expedition at once!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.OPT2: "Let us not overextend; why send an armada when a few ships will do?"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.OPT3: "Let us steer clear of Africa. Who knows what trouble could lie there?"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.T: "Looking to India"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.D: "Having established a presence in Africa, we are tantalizingly close to India itself. Appreciative of Almeida's success, the crown has vested him with the title “Viceroy of India.” Of course, as we yet have little presence in India this title is mostly ceremonial. Both Almeida and the crown, however, have plans to change that, both revolving around the potentially lucrative spices of Cannanore. \n\nPast that, whether their plans are the same remains to be seen. "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.OPT1: "Let us deal diplomatically for a foothold in India, as per the crown's plan!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.OPT2: "Let us listen to Almeida and use some “persuasion”"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.T: "The Zamorin"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.D: "While our setting up of trading posts in India has so far met with great success, more than one local Hindu prince is jealous of our profits. One of the most prominent, known simply as ‘The Zamorin,' rules over the rich port of Calicut and has begun assembling an alliance against us! Rather than respecting our trade, he demands payment for all the lost trade income he blames on us having better offers than he...\n\nAlmeida wishes to meet this threat head-on at sea rather than wait for the Zamorin to come to us..."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.OPT1: "We must prepare for battle on the seas."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.OPT2: "Let us seek an alliance of our own to contain this threat."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.OPT3: "Give the Zamorin what he wants."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.T: "Almeida's Son Killed!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.D: "After Francisco de Almeida finally settled in as Viceroy of Portugal's holdings in India, tragedy struck. Francisco had sent his only son, Lourenco de Almeida, on routine expeditions of his own to secure additional trade opportunities on the Indian coast. However, news arrived back in Cannanore that Lourenco had run across an Egyptian fleet heading to India to pirate our hard-won trade! \n\nIn the resulting skirmish, Lourenco was killed. Francisco did not take this news well, and went into a deep depression and rage, vowing revenge. His men, having followed him for years through great hardship, are likely to follow him come what may. \n\nMeanwhile back in Lisbon, whispers at the royal court have begun to accuse Almeida of treason against the crown, that he only sought power from himself in India, where distance already makes him de-facto independent. No doubt these whispers are at least partly fueled by jealousy. Indeed, Almeida has been a loyal servant of Portugal since before the way to India was even discovered. However, the risk of treason is real, and it is not to be taken lightly."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.OPT1: "Clearly, Almeida is no longer fit for duty."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.OPT2: "Almeida has proven a loyal servant of the state."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.OPT3: "Lourenco's death is an unacceptable loss!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.T: "Almeida Defies the King"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.D: "Almeida's thirst for revenge was clearly greater than anyone anticipated. No sooner had Alfonso de Albuquerque landed in India as Almeida's replacement than Almeida did the unthinkable. Arresting Alfonso, he gathered a fleet and set sail on his own behalf. He promises, however, that he will return his fleet and men to the authority of Portugal as soon as his revenge is complete."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.OPT1: "He is nothing but a traitor!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.OPT2: "We have no choice but to hope he keeps his word."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.14.T: "Securing our African Interests "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.14.D: "Merchants and explorers have discovered new sources of wealth on the African continent, circumventing the Arab-controlled caravans across the Sahara. \n\nNeedless to say, established trading interests take none too kindly to our presence, and may agitate locals against us. Accordingly, merchants have asked us for our help in securing their posts on the Ivory Coast. "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.14.OPT1: "They shall receive our help."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.14.OPT2: "The merchants must take care of themselves."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.T: "Sephardic Jews Arrive in Portugal"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.D: "Portugal has long had an established, prosperous, and well-tolerated Jewish community within its borders. At times, a full 20% of the population of the Kingdom of Portugal has been Jewish. \n\nWith the final fall of the Moors in Granada came a great expulsion of the Jews throughout the realms of the Catholic Monarchs of Castile and Aragon. Many of them fled to friendly lands such as Holland. However, the presence of a strong Jewish community here has drawn the majority of them to seek asylum in Portugal. \n\nGranting them asylum in his realm might bring [Root.Monarch.GetName] many advantages. Indeed, several of the most prominent families among them have even promised gifts and skilled craftsmen for weaponry to aid [Root.Monarch.GetName] in wars against the Muslims if he lets them in. \n\nAt the same time, tension between Jews and Christians in Portugal is never far from the surface, and an influx of Jewish refugees may spark a crisis."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.OPT1: "Accept their gifts and grant them full toleration."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.OPT2: "Admit them into our realm in exchange for military aid."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.OPT3: "We do not need to risk the wrath of Castile or of our own people."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.16.T: "Expulsion of the Jews?"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.16.D: "There is no question that the Jewish refugees who settled in Portugal from Castile have become very successful. In fact, [Root.Monarch.GetName] considers them an essential part of the Portuguese economy. \n\nHowever, their success has caused heightened tension from non-Jewish Portuguese citizens who feel slighted by the Jews' success. Now, a group of clergy and middle-class Christians has arrived at court, along with indignant diplomats from our neighbors, demanding that we cease allowing the Jews to live freely among us."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.16.OPT1: "Expel the Jews and confiscate their wealth!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.16.OPT2: "Attempt to Convert the Jews to Christianity so they can stay!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.16.OPT3: "The King will not be bullied into abusing his subjects!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.17.T: "Securing Malacca Trade"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.17.D: "Having conquered the famous port of Malacca, the merchants in charge of the trading feitoria there expected to seize the same control of the spice trade that the Malaccans themselves had once enjoyed. However, they soon found out that without the centralized bureaucracy and navy from the Malacca Sultans, the importance of the port was greatly diminished. Portuguese merchants now had to compete with a host of smaller ports instead of profiting from Malacca's fabled riches. Action must be taken if we are to received the benefits from the city that our admirals promised us when we set out to take it."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.17.OPT1: "We must spare no expenses to revive the city!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.17.OPT2: "Shouldn't these merchants be helping us rather than complaining?"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.18.T: "Portuguese Arrivals in Japan"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.18.D: "Our first arrivals on the fabled isles of Japan were met with a curious mixture of respectful awe and bewildered disdain. Despite this, however, we were received hospitably, and our hosts' face lit up when we began to describe our weaponry to him! \n\nAfter several days of demonstrating our firearms, including not only their usage but a description of the various parts involved and even how to clean them properly. The local lord of the place, called Satsuma, was most eager to obtain these weapons, and promised well-made swords, silks, and chinaware in exchange for a steady supply of weapons."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.18.OPT1: "By all means, let the trade commence!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.18.OPT2: "These seems too risky, we'd best not meddle in local warfare like this."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.T: "Ferdinand Magellan"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.D: "An ambitious explorer has arrived at our court seeking an audience, named Ferdinand Magellan. He has already distinguished himself on discovery missions for both the Spanish and Portuguese crowns, including in the now-famous expeditions of Francisco de Almeida. He proposes a new scheme for sailing to the Spice Islands, one where we avoid the tumultuous African and Indian Ocean waters altogether and sail around the southern tip of America instead. Not only would this potentially be a better route to the Spice Islands, he argues, but would also provide the chance to discover yet more new and rich lands beyond the South Atlantic. \n\nRemembering how the Portuguese crown rejected the plans of Christopher Columbus to their everlasting sorrow, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is most reluctant to reject Magellan's plan. However, going under South America also risks violating the Treaty of Tordesillas, angering the Spanish and giving them cause for war."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.OPT1: "Allow him to set out at once!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.OPT2: "Best to keep him here to further our own interests without angering Spain."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.OPT3: "We already have the route to the Spice Islands well-established, we need no more."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.20.T: "Societas Jesu in Asia"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.20.D: "As Europe is rocked by Reformation and Counter-Reformation, the effort to spread the Catholic faith outside of Europe itself has grown apace. \n\nFrom one of our garrisons in India comes news that none other than Francis Xavier, co-founder of the Societas Jesu, has arrived. He wishes first to purify the faith among the Portuguese there, who he finds altogether too focused on wealth and too lax in their faith, and then from there spread the faith to all of our holdings in Asia. Xavier wishes for us to allow him leave to bring yet more Jesuits from Spain into our realm, or else set up our own Inquisition to help him reach his goal. \n\nNaturally, this might bite into our profits, but Xavier and many devout voices insist that this is a worthy sacrifice for the glory of God."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.20.OPT1: "No one expected the Portuguese Inquisition!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.20.OPT2: "Allow the Jesuits to pursue their missionary efforts unmolested."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.20.OPT3: "Keep them out of our trading posts, we don't need them stirring up trouble."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.21.D: "Once a luxury only imported over harsh land routes from the East, sugarcane has found a favorable climate in our new colonies and is proving to be more profitable than anyone could have imagined as it becomes accessible to the public for the first time. \nOur colony in Brazil especially is beginning to find great success in growing this crop.

 FEE_Portugal_Events.101.D: "Our tolerance of Jewish settlers and immigrants, either fleeing persecution or freely settling in the Portugese valleys and hills have brought us to a breaking point. The Jews now have a large influence over the courts and administration of our Empire and much of our countryside is comprised of large Jewish villages and towns. Many are urging us to decide wether or not we should further this development and fully embrace the Jewish Faith. This would be very beneficial to us but would of course anger much of our Catholic population."

 FEE_Renaissance_Events.1.D: "Over the course of a century, intellectual life on the Italian peninsula has seen stronger and stronger influences from the knowledge rediscovered in the ancients, Greek and Roman writers, philosophers, and orators, from Plato to Cicero. This development has largely happened in the interest of the public good, that a well-educated populace might better safeguard our civilisation than one could in the barbaric Middle Ages separating us from those glorious times. \nThese principles have become pervasive in our society, and carries influence not just in philosophy and humanist teachings, but in art and architecture, law and warfare. \nOver time, this will make our nation strong and our people indomitable, in the realm of the temporal as well as the spiritual."

 FEE_Renaissance_Events.2.T: "Renaissance Influences in $COUNTRY$"
 FEE_Renaissance_Events.2.D: "Spreading from Italy and across Europe, the cultural \"rebirth\" of the ancient Greeks and Romans brings with it new ways of thinking about the world we live in. They give us a new understanding of how we relate to other people, in ways that changes politics as much as it changes art. While encompassing a multitude of cultural movements, expressed in a multitude of ways in different places, there are a few cire tenets bringing continuity to our cultural age. \nThese principles have become pervasive in our society, and carries influence not just in philosophy and humanist teachings, but in art and architecture, law and warfare. \nOver time, this will make our nation strong and our people indomitable, in the realm of the temporal as well as the spiritual."

 FEE_Renaissance_Events.3.T: "End of Renaissance Culture"
 FEE_Renaissance_Events.3.D: "As there was no moment that marked the beginning, there is no moment to mark the end. No great event, no grand last stand. As the principles guiding art and philosophy for the last century or more fades in relevance, there is no one to take notice.

 FEE_Russia_Events.1.D: "The grand city of St. Petersburg has served as the capital of all Russia for years, being the gateway to the Baltic's riches for both our merchants and our admirals; through it has flowed Russian culture and influence for many years. Unfortunately, the capital lies in a dangerous strategic position, for as the riches of Scandinavia and Germany flow into St. Petersburg, so do their dangers. The Gulf of Finland is easily traversable by enemy fleets, and currently any aggressor against us may sail straight into the heart of our capital, into the heart of Russia itself. There is a way to defend the city, however. Kotlin Island stands between the mouth of the Neva and the Gulf proper, meaning all ships coming to harbour at the capital must pass it. Our engineers have proposed a large fortress, to be built on Kotlin Island, which would stand proudly amongst the sea, a great bastion which all enemies must defeat to negotiate safe passage to St. Petersburg!

 FEE_Saxony_Events.1.D: "Following joint rule for two decades, the two brothers ruling the von Wettin family in 1485 divided Saxony between them. While in many ways remaining a joint duchy, the elder brother, Ernest, gained the electoral lands around Wittenberg, before dividing the duchy by \"I cut, you choose,\" where Ernest divided the lands. The younger brother, Albert, picked the lands around Meissen, while Ernest gained the recently acquired lands of Thuringia.\nWhile the Wettins remained split in two branches ever since, the Lands of Saxony would be reunited by Maurice of Saxony in 1547, following the Schmalkaldic War. \nNevertheless, decades of separation prevented Saxony from effeciently competing with the dynamic rise of its neighboring rivals, the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg."

 FEE_Saxony_Events.2.D: "While our centuries-old house of von Wettin has grown into one of the great powers of Central Germany, we were not invested with the Dukedom of Saxony until 1423. \nAt about the same time, in 1415, our neighbors the Hohenzollerns were granted Electoral rights by investment of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. This upstart family does not know the lands of Central Germany the way we do, and cannot yet see that we are the rightful great power of the region."

 FEE_Saxony_Events.2.OPT2: "A diplomatic approach could benefit both our houses."

 FEE_Saxony_Events.3.T: "The University of Wittenberg"
 FEE_Saxony_Events.3.D: "Established in 1502 by Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony, the University of Wittenberg was a grand, but still fresh institution that had barely opened its doors before the events that would make it go down in history.\nOne of the very first professors was the theologian Martin Luther, who would go on to become the spark that fired up the Protestant Reformation, with the university of Saxony as one of the earliest centres of the Reformation.\nWith that in mind, what kind of education should we encourage at this great, new university."

Although he was granted safe passage to the disputation, that will only last for another day before forces will be sent after him.

 FEE_Saxony_Events.5.T: "Lurking Crypto-calvinism"
 FEE_Saxony_Events.5.D: "Crypto-Calvinism was the influence of Calvinism within the Lutheran Church, and was considered a serious threat to the new church following the death of Martin Luther.\nIn Saxony, Calvinist principles were fairly common among prominent figures as a result of the powerful Philippist party's secret promotion of Calvinism in the electorate. (Philippist after Philipp Melanchton, Luther's closest ally.)\nWhile Crypto-Calvinists seized power in the Saxon church during the rule of Elector Augustus, but gradually works that were undeniably Calvinist in nature came to light. In 1574 the entire leadership of the Philippist party were arrested, and their efforts were counteracted until the establishment of the Lutheran Formula of Concord - defining a \"true\" Lutheran doctrine - ended their influence completely."

 FEE_Saxony_Events.6.D: "The Corpus Evangelicorum was a gathering of Protestant princes that was finally formally established following the Peace of Westphalia. \nAfter the Thirty Years' War, the Corpus Evangelicorum would not struggle with enormous religious questions the way it would have in the preceding century, but it nevertheless kept meeting over various issues until the end of the Empire in 1806. \n\nThe Elector of Saxony held the privileged position of leader of the Corpus Evangelicorum, thanks to Saxony's status as the birthplace of the reformation and as the predominant Protestant state at the time of the Corpus' formation. This tradition held so strong, that even Saxon electors who converted to Catholicism were allowed to lead the gatherings, provided the privy council was given charge of all matters religious in Saxony, and only admitted Protestants."
 FEE_Saxony_Events.6.OPT1: "Peace to the Empire and glory to Saxony!"

 FEE_Saxony_Events.7.T: "Transfer Religious Responsibility to the Privy Council"
 FEE_Saxony_Events.7.D: "In 1697 the Elector Augustus II von Wettin converted from Protestantism to Catholicism. This was largely due to his ascension to the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as the Polish king was required to be Catholic.\nAs the Dukes of Saxony were renowned as champions of the reformation, Saxony remained the leader of the Corpus Evangelicorum, the imperial board of the Protestant estates, but now with the Catholic Augustus at its head. Augustus guaranteed Saxon Protestantism however, and followed orthodox Lutheran doctrine in his dealings with other Protestant states. However, to guarantee future von Wettins for the throne of Poland meant that every possible successor had to convert to Catholicism, including the future elector Augustus III. Upon this the Estates of Saxony began protesting, threatening revolt in defense of the Protestant faith. Augustus II therefore transferred all religious control in Saxony to the Electoral privy council, as suggested by the Corpus Evangelicorum. The privy council also established that only a Protestant might partake, which meant that Protestantism in Saxony was safeguarded, and disaster averted."

 FEE_Saxony_Events.8.D: "Dresden Frauenkirche was torn down in 1727, and a Protestant church was built in the Baroque style between 1726 and 1743. The tall, bell-shaped dome would come to define any view of Dresden for the following two centuries.\n\nHowever, the Catholic elector Augustus III felt that Dresden needed religious balance, and therefore in 1738 initiated the construction of the Katholische Hofkirche (which would later become Dresden Cathedral). The Hofkirche was completed in 1751, and meant that Dresden had not just one, but two enormous Baroque churches."
 FEE_Saxony_Events.8.OPT1: "Dresden has church building fever!"
 FEE_Saxony_Events.8.OPT2: "Let's put the money towards other civic projects."

 FEE_Saxony_Events.9.T: "Maria Josepha of Austria"
 FEE_Saxony_Events.9.D: "Maria Josepha was the wife of Frederick Augustus II, and thereby Electress of Saxony and Queen consort of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1734 to 1757. While she lived in Saxony, she often accompanied her husband to Poland, even several times after he became embroiled in the War of the Polish Succession. She learnt to speak Polish, and was often present for assemblies of the Polish parliament.\nAs a strong political figure, she practically governed Saxony during Frederick Augustus' absence, though she was never officially named regent. She was a dedicated Catholic, even being chided by her confessor for being more religious than behooved a person outside a monastic order. Nevertheless she preached tolerance, and gave alms as much to poor Protestants as poor Catholics.\nAs a former heiress presumtive of the imperial throne, she became an active player in the War of the Austrian Succession, before ceding her claim in favour of an alliance with Austria. Her politicking continued her entire life by influencing the power balance between Saxony and Poland as well as between her sons, the heirs to the thrones. During the Seven Years War, she was placed under house arrest by the Prussians, but kept on communicating with the outside world through the use of Prussian connections and letters written in invisible ink."
 FEE_Saxony_Events.9.OPT1: "A great queen, for Poland and Saxony both."

 FEE_Saxony_Events.10.T: "Martin Luther Publishes Theological Treatise"
 FEE_Saxony_Events.10.D: "Before the reformation, Martin Luther was a theological scholar at the university of Wittenberg, and his writings were academic in nature. While certainly critical of aspects of the church, they were meant as texts that searched for new answers within old doctrines, rather than presenting new doctrines of their own. It was largely through papal and imperial reaction to the Lutheran texts that they became directives of faith that sparked Luther's reformational work.\n\nNow one of these texts has been discovered before reaching wide circulation, and it does have some deeply incisive comments about papal practices. What is to be done with it?"
 FEE_Saxony_Events.10.OPT1: "These are some very good points, actually. Especially thesis eighty-six."
 FEE_Saxony_Events.10.OPT2: "Burn it. Does this lowly theologian think he knows God better than the Pope?"

 FEE_Saxony_Events.11.T: "Nikolaus Krell"
 FEE_Saxony_Events.11.D: "Nikolaus Krell was the chancellor of the elector of Saxony from 1589 to 1591, a position he used to further his Calvinist beliefs at the cost of Saxony's Protestant traditions. As an influential and capable politician, he ensured Calvinsits were appointed to high offices, especially in the church, and he had a translation of the bible with Calvinist annotations published and disseminated.\nIn the end, distrust of his faith and jealousy at his position and influence with the elector meant that when Elector Christian died in 1591, rivals in the nobility ensured that he was arrested. He remained imprisoned for ten years, six of them in trial at the Reichskammergericht, before being sentenced to death for Crypto-Calvinism.\nHe was decapitated in Dresden, and a paving stone with the letters \"Kr\" still marks the exact place of his death."
 FEE_Saxony_Events.11.OPT1: "He is too good to give up, even if he is a Calvinist."
 FEE_Saxony_Events.11.OPT2: "Crypto-Calvinists are trying to bring down everything Saxony stands for!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.1.T: "The Renaissance in Scotland"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.1.D: "While the Renaissance is in full swing in far-off Italy, under the blessed leadership of [SCO.Monarch.GetName], education and culture have flowered in Scotland at long last. The University of St. Andrews, one of the oldest such institutions in the British Isles, had already been founded in 1413, with the University of Glasgow and University of St. Andrew's following in 1450 and 1495. The pinnacle of this flowering came in 1496 with the Education Act of 1496, when Scotland became the first nation in the world to institute compulsory education (of landowners), for the purposes of fostering a more equitable justice system in Scotland."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.1.OPT1: "Pass the Education Act!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.1.OPT2: "Fund the Universities, but do not anger the Lords of Scotland"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.1.OPT3: "We don't need these dangerous new Italian ideas!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.2.T: "A Strategic Marriage"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.2.D: "With the rise of the Tudors in England and the Hundred Years' War drawing to a slow and painful close, Scotland stands at a crossroads. The English, ever seeking to expand into Scottish holdings, are a historic and existential threat, but currently exhausted from years of foreign engagements and civil wars, and are perhaps, for the first time in history, open to rapprochement with their northern neighbour. Meanwhile, France is the historic ally of Scotland, but with the English largely evicted from Europe, their interest in helping Scotland might well wane beyond repair if swift diplomatic action is not taken. The time has come for Scotland to solidify her diplomatic standing in Europe, but no longer can she dally between France in England: we must choose a side! And with several eligible daughters of House [SCO.Dynasty.GetName], a royal marriage could well seal whichever bond we pursue."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.2.OPT1: "Marriage with France"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.3.T: "Marriage Offer Spurned"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.3.D: "With the great displeasure we have been informed that our marriage proposal for Scotland was somehow spurned. If these Scottish dogs think they can just simply say \"no\" to us then they are even more stupid than we thought. But from such a situation another possibility emerges - we could use the wole confusion and simply press our claim to the Scottish throne by using pure force."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.3.OPT1: "They shall taste our swords!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.4.T: "Treaty of Perpetual Peace"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.4.D: "Sometimes, on a very rare occasion diplomacy indeed turns out to be stronger than the sword. By the grace of our Lord and Saviour, Scottish lords have come to their senses and finally noticed an other way to handle our tense situation. Instead conducting another pointless assault and fighting never ending skirmishes, they decided to offer us a deal - by terms of which our countries could amend mutual relationships."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.4.OPT1: "This might be the beginning of our reconciliation!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.5.T: "[SCO.Monarch.GetName] Visits the Highlands"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.5.D: "In 1494, James IV of Scotland, one of the few late Scottish kings to learn Gaelic, made a series of visits to the Highlands after reconciling with the power of the Lordship of the Isles and the Douglass clan. Not only was such a visit almost unheard of for Scottish kings, but James decided that coming as a friend to the clans rather than as an assertive overlord would prove more productive, and this was indeed the case. After many royal feasts and hunts with the various great clan chieftains of the North, we must now decide - shall we attempt to divert the clans from constant petty warfare via economic projects? Or are we to placate the chiefs in exchange for loyalty?"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.5.OPT1: "Let us impose order on these wild northerners!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.5.OPT2: "Let us continue to befriend the clans"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.6.T: "Naval Expansion and the Great Michael"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.6.D: "In the aftermath of the fall of Constantinople, [SCO.Monarch.GetName], having settled internal conflicts and achieved peace, however uneasy, with England, has become filled with religious zeal, and the desire to use Scotland's position as the balance decider in European alliances to form a new crusade, one that would unite Christendom against the Turkish menace. However, to do so, a great fleet will first be needed to get to the Levant in the first place..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.7.T: "Disaster at Flodden"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.7.D: "In 1513, as a result of the renewal of the Auld Alliance with France, the insolent English monarch Henry VIII rebuffed James IV's attempts to secure peace in the British Isles, declaring himself the \"verie owner of Scotland\", bringing yet another Anglo-Scottish War to the island. The Scottish army, ill-equipped and badly led, managed to capture English border forts before being caught at Flodden. The battle was in name only, as it quickly became a massacre: the flower of the Scottish nobility, the knights of Scotland, were slaughtered almost to a man, and the Royal Scottish army for a time ceased to exist as a credible fighting force. The battle is remembered today in the Scottish eulogy song which laments: The Flowers of the Forest are a'wede away."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.7.OPT1: "O God, why hast thou forsaken Scotland?"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.7.OPT1.TT: "Propose Peace?"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.7.OPT2: "We shall never surrender!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.8.T: "Corruption in the Church"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.8.D: "As Protestant views gain steam on the continent, nowhere in Europe is the Catholic Church as corrupt as the Church in Scotland. “Pilates, not Prelates,” Pope Eugenius IV had described Scottish bishops. Priests are regularly ordained who cannot even read or write, while many others are openly drunk or lecherous, while still others use their positions to increase their own luxurious dwellings (which more often than not are fought over by bastard sons after the death of the priest), while rural church buildings fall into disrepair."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.9.T: "Early Scottish Reformers"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.9.D: "With the arrival of preachers Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart, the Reformation has arrived in Scotland. Bringing revolutionary Protestant ideas to a nation weary of corruption in the church, their words spread like wildfire. Ever-larger crowds, including some of noble stock, follow them wherever they go, and seditious whispers against the Roman church are not so quiet anymore..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.9.OPT3: "Let us hear what these new preachers have to say..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.10.T: "Martyrdom of Patrick Hamilton"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.10.D: "Rather than seek reconciliation, the Scottish monarch, [SCO.Monarch.GetName], egged on by the Catholic cardinals, has decided to make a public example of the Protestant preacher Patrick Hamilton in order to quell the sedition caused by his words. However, attempting intimidating Scots has rarely proven successful, and the courage at which Hamilton met his death only inspired more people to follow his ideas and those of other reformers. One observer remarked to the presiding Cardinal \"My Lord, if you burn any more, let them be burned in cellars, for the reek of Patrick Hamiltion has infected as many as it blew upon.\""
 FEE_Scotland_Events.10.OPT1: "Only time will tell what comes of this..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.11.T: "John Knox"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.11.D: "Having already been involved as the right-hand man of George Wishart, an early Scottish reformers, former Catholic priest John Knox was banished after the initial suppression of the reformers' message led to his leading a daring assault on the Cardinal's castle by protestant zealots, during which the Cardinal was killed. \n\nCondemned as a rower on a French galley, a fate which normally would prove fatal. While physically weakened and no longer able to wield a great Scottish two-handed sword as he did under Wishart, Knox's already formidable personality was only honed by his experience aboard the galleys. \n\nHaving spent several years under the strict tutelage of John Calvin in Geneva, Knox adopted a rare but potent strain of Protestantism, and returned to Scotland determined to bring that faith to his homeland."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.11.OPT1: "What could this mean for Scotland?"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.12.T: "The Lords of the Congregation"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.12.D: "While the bold new ideas brought by the flaming personality of Knox have not officially been accepted, many of the Scottish nobles, whether through genuine belief, disgust at the corruption of the clergy, or simply a desire to reduce royal power, have secretly formed a pact, calling themselves of Lords of the Congregation. Their seditious spirit was fueled by Calvin's and Knox's radical interpretation of Scripture, which gave license to and indeed encouraged \"lesser magistrates\" to rise up and install a more \"godly\" ruler."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.12.OPT1: "How dare they?"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.12.OPT1.tooltip1: "Other §YReformed§! countries might see an opportunity in supporting the rebels..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.13.T: "Brothers in Arms?"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.13.D: "The news have arrived that in the distant land of Scotland our brothers and sisters in faith have taken up their arms and trying to impose rightful way of interpreting the very words of our Lord and Saviour upon their ungodly ruler! Perhaps by providing them enough help both in terms of gold and willing to fight souls we would turn the tide of such a godly conflict towards the victory of true believers? Yet, doing so would also gravely infuriate [SCO.Monarch.GetName] of [SCO.GetName]."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.15.OPT1: "Wonderfully!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.16.T: "Reimposition of Church Hierarchy"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.16.D: "After successive waves of reformers had taken control of the church largely out of both royal and papal hands, the Stuart kings often sought ways to reign in the autonomy of both the church and the nobles who ran it. Taking a page from Scotland's southern neighbor, [SCO.Monarch.GetName] has come up with an ambitious plan of enforcing a common book of prayer (approved by the crown of course), and generally bringing the church, and the nobles who back the church, back undernational control.\n\nOne of the greatest obstacles to [SCO.Monarch.GetName]'s plan, and to central authority in general, is the rigorously Presbyterian structure of the church instituted by Knox. In this structure, churches are governed by an assembly of the elders of each congregation, who in turn comprise the General Assembly, with no central figurehead or hierarchy. For [SCO.Monarch.GetName]'s plan to make any progress, he must first reinstitute a more traditional hierarchy of bishops, beholden to the crown."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.16.OPT1: "Crack down on the Presbyterians"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.16.OPT2: "Make Concessions to the Presbyterians"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.17.T: "Jenny Geddes and the Prayer Book Riots"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.17.D: "The imposition of a uniform prayer book and the re-introduction of pipe organs - derisively called a “kist o'whistles” by Scots - to Scottish churches was meant merely as a benign first stepin [SCO.Monarch.GetName]'s plans. However, the mere suggestion of “popery” was met with resistance fierce enough to completely catch [SCO.Monarch.GetName] completely off guard. Churches all over Scotland bristled with the changes, and it only took a spark to light them.\n\nThat spark came from Edinburgh itself, the historic heart of the Scottish church. When the new prayer book was first read, one Jenny Geddes, a local young woman, was the first to stand. \"De'il gie you colic, the wame o' ye, fause thief; daur ye say Mass in my lug?\" she yelled. Picking up a humble stool, universally used by congregation members in church's largely barren of seating, Geddes hurled the stool directly at the offending preacher. Within minutes, the entire city was up in arms, and the tumult quickly spread throughout Scotland."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.17.OPT1: "Back down, and quickly!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.17.OPT2: "The Presbyterians will bend, or be destroyed!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.18.T: "Signing of the National Covenant"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.18.D: "The revolt of the Presbyterians has once again brought the Lords of the Congregation, never far from the public eye, to the forefront of Scottish politics again. Now, however, fearing the threat of royal absolutism, even more nobles have joined their ranks. Together with notable Presbyterian ministers, representatives from the burghers, and several minor gentry, they have drafted a landmark document, the National Covenant.\n\nThe Covenanters, as they became known, pledged their loyalty both to “the true religion” and to royal authority, but only within limits far below those of European absolutist monarchs. Copies of the Covenant were swiftly carried from Edinburgh throughout all Scotland.\n\nEven more alarming, Scotland's greatest military leaders, including Archibald Campbell, a Highland Chieftain, and Alexander Leslie, a distinguished veteran of the War of the Protestant League on the continent."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.26.D: "Scotland looks enviously at the vast colonial holdings of the Catholic empires of Spain and Portugal. To gain Scotland a colonial foothold at a key location in the New World, an ambitious merchant has lobbied endless for a daring project aimed at Darien on the Panama isthmus. To catch up with the head start of the Spanish, a concerted effort to transport many colonists at once, rather than colonize piecemeal, is the only option (at least that's what everyone believes). Naturally the investment involved would be substantial, but the potential payoff may well be enormous."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.29.D: "With the coming of globalized trade and improved infrastructure also comes a decline, at long last, of the pre-feudal clan system which has ruled in the Highlands for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Eager to keep up with their Lowland counterparts, Highland clan leaders are fast shifting their emphasis from the upkeep of armed retinues to economic gain. Most lucrative in the Highlands is the mass raising and export of sheep.

 FEE_Scotland_Events.30.D: "With the increase in trade from the New World comes many economic opportunities, both for Scots who move abroad and for those who stay home. Recently, the smoking of tobacco has become all the rage in Europe, and Scotland's privileged position with access to the American colonies which provide the weed has fostered a prosperous trade. In Glasgow in particular, a thriving sector of trade has arisen, leading to a new class of wealthy businessmen known as “tobacco lairds.” Known by their bright red clothing (some say to hide the stains of tobacco juice), these capitalist barons could definitely help our economy grow."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.31.D: "While the focus on the continent is on the new wave of French and German thinkers, Scotland in the 18th century is experiencing a new age of cultural, intellectual, and scientific flowering of its own. In Scotland, however, there is much less focus on abstract and philosophical questions and pure reason and a more solid foundation of empiricism and a search for practical benefits to society. After all, who really cares how many angels can dance on the head of a pin? The strong network of universities, clubs, printing houses, libraries, museums, and societies that had grown up over centuries have already helped create a vibrant intellectual culture unmatched anywhere in the world. Royal patronage, however, would definitely be welcomed in solidifying Scotland's position as intellectual capital of the world."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.32.D: "\"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.\" Such is the book that has recently appeared in bookmarkets throughout Scotland, and the ideas espoused there in are spreading like wildfire. The author, Adam Smith, has introduced the concept of the \"invisible hand\", the process by which free market economies control themselves and lead to prosperity through health competition. While not the first to espouse capitalism, Smith would come to be its intellectual champion, framing it in a coherent theory of economics for the first time. His advocacy for a restriction of government control over the economy, while potentially a boon for the Scottish people, runs counter to much of what has traditionally been accepted in the royal court."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.32.OPT1: "Let us embrace the free market!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.33.D: "While steam engines in various forms have been cropping up throughout Europe in this new age of gadgets, it is in Scotland that the true breakthrough in engineering has occurred. James Watt, a relatively unknown tinkerer from Glasgow, has realized that current steam engines waste a good deal of energy and has invented a \"separate condenser\", which vastly increases the efficiency. This invention would come to revolutionize industry by making the steam engine into the workhorse of the Industrial Revolution, making mass production of coal and cloth more possible than ever before!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.34.D: "An answer to French philosophe's abstract and philosophy-focused work, the first \"Encyclopedia\", a group of academics in Edinburgh have decided to produce a more practical and universal Encyclopedia, the Encyclopedia Brittanica, as a summation of all of human knowledge.

As a result, the eighteenth century saw a \"Scottish Renaissance\", a period of great flowering of romantic literature featuring the Scotland of old. Notable authors included Sir Walter Scott, Macpherson (author of the apocryphal Celtic epic \"Ossian\"), and poet Robert \"Robbie\" Burns. Their works helped spark a revival in Scottish national pride and dignity, and the desire to maintain Scotland's unique culture in the midst of great social change. Additionally, they rehabilitated the image of Scotland. No longer seen as uncouth northern barbarians, the people of Europe now see the Scots for who they were all along: fearless, hospitable, chivalrous, and virtouos."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.35.OPT1: "Glory to our Celtic ancestors! Let us support this noble endeavor!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.35.OPT2: "How interesting"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.35.OPT3: "Pah! We look to the future, not the past!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.36.T: "Scotland and Modern Warfare"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.36.D: "For centuries, Scotland has relied on its tried and true tactics to win in wars. Known as “devilsin skirts” by their enemies, Scotland has a reputation unmatched in the world for the ferocity and courage of her soldiers. In the rapidly changing modern era, however, some military theorists suggest that the prowess of the individual soldier will soon become irrelevant in a war decided by industrial might. Our men may not like it, but they may have to learn to fight as a single machine-like unit rather than as courageous Highland warriors to win wars."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.36.OPT1: "We cannot abandon the heritage that has served us so well!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.36.OPT2: "Reform the army but preserve its traditions"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.36.OPT3: "Forge a Modern Military"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.299.T: "Death at Flodden"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.300.OPT1: "..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.37.T: "The Education Act of $YEAR$"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.37.D: "The Education Act was a law passed by the Scottish Parliament in 1496, that required the oldest sons of every landowner to attend school to study Latin, arts and law. This was intended to improve the administration of justice across the country, by making sure local authorities understood the Scottish legal code. \nThe law text described requirements for advancing from one part of the education to another, and was in that sense an early standardised curriculum. The law was the first case of compulsory education in Scotland, and remained in force until the 19th century."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.37.OPT1: "Every landowner should understand our laws."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.37.OPT2: "Education should focus on the military."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.38.T: "Anti-French Sentiment"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.38.D: "Despite the great benefit of our Auld Alliance, the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ people of Scotland are worried about our cooperation with the French, one of the fiercest opponents of the reformation in Europe. What started as a whisper in town squares has become howling demands that we break our diplomatic bonds with them."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.38.OPT1: "Our alliance stands for a reason! The peasants can go back to their hovels and pray."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.38.OPT2: "It is time to let France know how important our faith is to us."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.39.T: "The Claim of Right"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.39.D: "In 1689, shortly after the Glorious Revolution, the Scottish Parliament passed the Claim of Right Act. The law deposed the former King James who had already been forced to cede the English throne in favour of King William III, maintaining the union of the two crowns. \nHowever, the act also expanded the power of the Scottish parliament, and ensured that any monarch of Scotland would have to accept these documents in order to legally hold the throne. If we were to force such a document upon our overlord, we could weaken their influence while retaining peace."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.39.OPT1: "It is better if we comply with our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s wishes."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.39.OPT2: "Scotland needs to ensure its position in the new status quo."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.39.OPT2.tt: "Our overlord will get a chance to respond."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.40.T: "The Scottish Present their Claim of Right"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.40.D: "The Scottish parliament has taken the opportunity of a change of rulers to pass laws that require any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to acknowledge the Scottish Parliament if they are to be seen as lawful. This leaves their Parliament in charge of many royal matters, while balancing the monarch's rights with obligations to the country. \n\nWhile this is seems utterly unacceptable, if we were to accept the laws, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] would be the legal ruler of Scotland in every sense."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.40.OPT1: "I will tear their constitution to shreds!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.40.OPT2: "They can do what they want, as long as they know who truly is their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 FEE_Tuscany_Events.1.T: "The Thornton Expedition"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.1.D: "In 1608, Captain Robert Thornton was commissioned by Ferdinando de Medici to prepare for the establishment of a Tuscan settlement in South America.\nThornton was successful in his journey, and following exploration of the Amazon and the Orinoco he planned for the colony to be established in what is today French Guyana.\n\nWith a perfect place found, and without losing a single man on the expedition, Thornton returned to Tuscany. However, Ferdinando had died, and his successor was uninterested in continuing the colonisation project of his predecessor. Despite the testimony of both Thornton and a native he had brought back that there were many riches and much commerce to be found, no one could be convinced to pursue the scheme of a colony.\nThis saw the end of the only attempt by an Italian state to colonise the New World."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.1.OPT1: "Send him off to found our colony!"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.1.OPT2: "A commissioned captain would be very useful."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.1.OPT3: "This captain speaks madness, send him away."

 FEE_Tuscany_Events.2.T: "Freedom of Religion in Tuscany"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.2.D: "In the late 16th century, Cosimo de Medici, first Grand Duke of Tuscany introduced laws that would allow his citizens great freedoms in the practice of their religion. Thanks to his good relations with the Pope, Cosimo was able to ban the clergy from holding administrative positions, and allow people to choose their own method of worship.\nNearly eight decades before the Peace of Westphalia these laws were unprecedented in Europe, and especially in a catholic princedom. Nevertheless it led to Tuscany becoming an early destination for religious migrants, aiding the Grand Duchy's prosperity."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.2.OPT1: "These are wise reforms."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.2.OPT2: "No. Every soul in our duchy must follow the $MONARCHTITLE$'s lead."

 FEE_Tuscany_Events.3.T: "The Emperor Condemns Tuscany's Elevation"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.3.D: "The Pope has finally acknowledged the achievements of the Duchy of Florence, and proclaimed it a Grand Duchy. However, not everyone is thrilled by this acknowledgement of our glory.\nThe emperorhas condemned the Pope's proclamation as invalid, as Tuscany is nominally an imperial fief."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.3.OPT1: "The emperor will not stand in the way of God's will."

 FEE_Tuscany_Events.4.T: "The Emperor Confirms Tuscany's Elevation"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.4.D: "The Pope has finally acknowledged the achievements of the Duchy of Florence, and proclaimed it a Grand Duchy. However, some have had reservations as Tuscany is - at least nominally - an imperial fief.\nThankfully, the emperor has done the right thing, and proclaimed that the Pope's decree is God's will, and should be respected by all. We are now ready to take our place as one of the greatest states of Europe."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.4.OPT1: "All is right."

 FEE_Tuscany_Events.5.T: "The Construction Projects of Fernandino I"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.5.D: "Grand Duke Fernandino I was a kind ruler, always attempting to improve the situation of his subjects. One of his grand undertakings were extensive development projects in Tuscany.\n\nUnder his rule, roads were improved and developed across the duchy. Even more significantly, he oversaw the draining of much Tuscan marshland around Pisa, opening new land for settlement and industry. This was done by - among other things - the diverting of the Arno River into the Naviglio canal, which served to improve commerce between Florence and Pisa."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.5.OPT1: "Implement the projects in full."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.5.OPT2: "Expand the road network and charge high tolls."

 FEE_Tuscany_Events.6.T: "The $MONARCHTITLE$'s Treasury"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.6.D: "Tuscany under the $DYNASTY$s were long a financial powerhouse. However, thanks to banking and ownership of much of the local industry, the ruler exerted so much control over the duchy's economy that the distinction between personal and state funds was largely negligible.\nFor example did the Grand Duke have exclusive rights to the state's extraction of salt and minerals, but at the same time those funds were expected to also benefit the state. However, with so much personal control, what was state money and what was family money largely came down to the personality of the Grand Duke at the time."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.6.OPT1: "What difference is there between the interests of the $DYNASTY$s and of Tuscany?"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.6.OPT2: "The $DYNASTY$s rule for the Tuscan people."

 FEE_Tuscany_Events.7.T: "Accademia del Cimento"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.7.D: "The Accademia del Cimento was a scientific society established in Florence in 1657. It was one of the first of its kind, founded by students of Galielo and funded by Prince Leopold and his brother, the Grand Duke Ferdinando II.\nWhile it was never an official institution, and only kept meeting until Prince Leopold became a cardinal and moved to Rome in 1667, it was important for the development of the scientific principles of experimentation. It had the motto \"Try and try again,\" and published \"the Saggi,\" a book that became the standard laboratory manual of the 18th century (\"'Saggi di naturali esperienze fatte nell'Accademia del Cimento sotto la protezione del Serenissimo Principe Leopoldo di Toscan e descritte dal segretario di essa Accademia\")."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.7.OPT1: "Scientific societies sound very useful."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.7.OPT2: "We need to institutionalize the society for the benefit of $COUNTRY$."

 FEE_Tuscany_Events.8.T: "The Puritan Reforms of Cosimo III"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.8.D: "Cosimo III, the second to last Medici Grand Duke, was a harsh ruler, who thanks to disastrous financial policies and tyrannical practices forced the population numbers of Tuscany into an even steeper decline than it had been for the last century.\nNot only did he ruin Tuscany's economy and military strength, but also ended it's long tradition of religious toleration. Jews were banned from from having intercourse with Christians, and Christians were not allowed to work in establishments owned by Jews. Eventually Jews were forbidden from living with Christians as well, along with being forbidden from visiting Christian prostitutes (no doubt to protect their Christian virtue).Being a Puritan, Cosimo's legal reforms affected Christian life significantly as well, banning May celebrations and beheading sodomites.\n\nIn his defence, he desperately needed the money he got from fining crimes that did not result in swift execution."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.8.OPT1: "Ban these disgusting May celebrations and seize that delicious gold!"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.8.OPT2: "$COUNTRY$ cannot afford to be anything except tolerant."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.8.OPT3: "$COUNTRY$ has always been accepting of all kinds of practices."

 FEE_Tuscany_Events.10.T: "The Liberal Reforms of Peter Leopold"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.10.D: "Peter leopold of the house Habsburg-Lorraine, who ruled Tuscany between 1765 and 1790, was unpopular for an unusual reason. He introduced extensive social, legal and financial reforms in Tuscany, but met extensive opposition from all strata of society, as the reforms were considered too liberal. \nReforming the tax system to ease the burden on citizens, and conducting profitable public works were well received, but his attempts at reducing the power of the clergy was stopped by opposition from the Pope and his political allies. He did achieve many things, however, especially in guaranteeing legal rights for citizens, as well as through legislation and development of hospitals vastly improving the treatment of the mentally ill. This took place through the \"legge sui pazzi,\" the law of the insane, which was the first of its kind in Europe. \nA system for inoculation against smallpox was set up as an early predecessor of vaccination programs, and an early institution for the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents was founded. Peter Leopold also approved and attempted to introduce a constitution in Tuscany, which would see greater rights given to its citizens, and ensure a balance between legislative and executive powers.\n\nThe constitution met fierce resistance, even from those who would benefit from it, and was never put into effect, as Leopold in 1790 moved to Vienna upon his ascension to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.10.OPT1: "Implement these excellent reforms."
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.10.OPT2: "If the people don't want them we should place our efforts elsewhere."

 FEE_Tuscany_Events.12.T: "The Medici Oriental Press"
 FEE_Tuscany_Events.12.D: "The Medici Oriental Press was a printing press house established by Ferdinand de Medici in 1584. It had the objective of printing Christian works in Arabic, in the hopes of converting Muslims, and was granted a monopoly by the Pope to print books in \"foreign languages.\"\nThe press published some of the earliest printed works in Arabic, which came to include multiple non-religious works. It printed scientific works in original Arabic for circulation among European scientists, along with ancient Greek works translated and disseminated in Arabic."

 FEE_Venice_Events.1.T: "The Venetian Fleet"
 FEE_Venice_Events.1.D: "A new phase for the Venetian navy began in 1453, with the fall of Constantinople and the start of the centuries-old confrontation with the Turks. Faced with the growing threat to its maritime possessions, we are faced with the choice of constituting a real permanent naval navy, with dozens of galleys operating in peacetime and an appreciable force of more than one hundred galleys in the event of war."

"
 FEE_Venice_Events.2.OPT1: "Gloria a San Marco!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.3.T: "Naval Reform"
 FEE_Venice_Events.3.D: "At the same time, the spread of firearms gradually led to arming the galleys no longer with traditional Greek fire, but with artillery positioned at the bow and able to fire in the direction of the ship's advance. In the same period, new types of ships were developed: \n The brig, a small and fast ship, similar to a galley, for escort and transport services. About 20 m long and 3 m wide, for about 14 banks. \n The Galeotta, a small ship similar to a galley, but faster and more maneuverable. About 25 m long and 4 m wide, for about 15 banks. \n The Fusta, a small thin galley. About 35 m long and 5 m wide, for about 20 banks. \n The bastard galley, with larger dimensions and fuller stern shapes than the thin galley, capable of acting as a captain or patroness, that is, as a flagship."

 FEE_Venice_Events.4.T: "Governator de' Condannati"
 FEE_Venice_Events.4.D: "In the sixteenth century, the traditional small throwing weapons (bows and crossbows) were gradually replaced on board ships with more modern arquebuses. Also in the same period as the traditional free galleys, whose crews of convicts were composed of the so-called buonavoglia (i.e. free men recruited for pay) and zontaroli (i.e. debtors and convicts, who thus paid off their debt, or conscripts for the need for war), the first sforzate galleys began to join forces, that is, moved exclusively by convicts condemned to forced labor at the oars. The use of this type of ship, however, always remained rather limited in the Venetian navy, so much so that they did not even fall within the normal hierarchy of the fleet and constituted a separate flotilla, dependent on the so-called Governator de 'Condannati."

 FEE_Venice_Events.5.T: "Porta di Terra"
 FEE_Venice_Events.5.D: "After the fall of Constantinople (1453) and the consequent threat posed by the Ottoman fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, the arsenal underwent important works of war strengthening and productive structures; to commemorate these works, the monumental Porta di Terra (Porta da Tera) or Porta Magna was erected.

 FEE_Venice_Events.5.OPT1: "Marvelous!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.6.T: "Arsenal Expansion"
 FEE_Venice_Events.6.D: "Starting from 1473 and for a century until 1573, the third major phase of development of the arsenal took place, in which the last extensions were made by merging various surrounding marshy lands, with the construction of external residences for workers, public ovens and warehouses for cereals (the Darsena Nuovissima) and Galeazze, which led the arsenal to cover an area of almost 24 hectares."

A new facade was erected for the Volto del Bucintoro, expanding the square to accommodate the ceremonial boat of the same name, rebuilt between 1525 and 1526. Later on, was built, close to the walls overlooking the Rio of San Daniele, the artillery workshop - a building about 180 m long, still existing - and the fifteenth-century arms rooms were renovated. The close collaboration between artillerymen, smelters and manufacturers of powders, inside and outside the arsenal, contributed to the affirmation of the Venetian war industry, at the forefront in Europe for almost two centuries, with the invention of lethal weapons such as shooting mortars curved, huge siege bombards, culverins, falcons and battle falconets. A decree of the Commission of Ten and the Superintendent of Artillery of 1565 explicitly refers to the presence of "artillery factories" distributed in various warehouses in the arsenal."

In 1569 there was a powerful explosion of dust in the Celestia area, causing extensive damage to the walls, some building sites and the Celestia convent. A fifth extension dates back to the same period, with the excavation of the dock of the Galeazze, covering yards for the construction of this new type of battleship, which proved to be decisive for obtaining victory during the numerous naval battle.\n The construction of the small temple of the Madonna of the Arsenale leaning against the eastern tower of the Arsenale water gate; later on the architect Antonio da Ponte rebuilt the building of the Corderie; the monumental access portal to the arms rooms and to the artillery workshop that closes the Stradal de Campagna was built."

 FEE_Venice_Events.14.D: "On March 29, 1516, the government of the Serenissima (which would never have admitted an expulsion, given the economic importance of the community) put a hand to this situation by concentrating the Jews in the Ghetto Novo, an islet where a foundry once existed and which then housed a residential neighborhood. The inhabitants were then evicted to allow Jews to be imprisoned in a Ghetto. The only two entrances to the island, the bridges over the Rio di San Girolamo and the Rio del Ghetto, were closed at night and were guarded by Christian guardians, paid by the Jews themselves. \n The first inhabitants of the Ghetto Nuovo were the Jews of the Tokesca nation (Ashkenazi), which had the obligation to manage pawn shops. The Israelites were allowed few other professions: strazzarìa, or the second-hand trade, and medicine (doctors were allowed to leave the Ghetto at night to visit their patients)."

 FEE_Venice_Events.15.D: "In 1541 the Serenissima granted the Ghetto Vecchio (a neighborhood adjacent to the Ghetto Novo) to the Levantini, a group made up of merchants from the Ottoman Empire.

The Levantines had different obligations than the Germans: they did not deal with loans but were traders. This nation had decidedly particular habits: they exhibited sumptuous and oriental robes, with turbans and ornaments, decidedly contrasting with the modest German Jews."

 FEE_Venice_Events.16.T: "Il Ridotto"
 FEE_Venice_Events.16.D: "As the original European casino, Il Ridotto was a government-owned gambling house that formalized gambling and excessive money loss in Venice in 1638. It was established once the Great Council gave up on preventing people from playing for money during the Carnivale. Eventually, people from across Europe would come to Venice to test their luck and hopefully make a quick fortune. While the wing of the San Moisè Palace was supposedly open to the public, only nobles could afford the high stakes played there.\n\nWhile money flowed freely for more than a century, gambling was outlawed and Il Ridotto was closed in 1774."

When Tomasso Mocenigo died on the 4th of April 1423 Francesco competed for the supreme magistracy against five other candidates, all more mature than himself, among whom Pietro Loredan excelled on the ballot. By exploiting his partisans within the electoral college, Foscari managed to bring his competitors into disrepute, all while Venice was at war with Milan in the Guerre di Lombardia."

Marina, was the most important of the household; he was orphaned of his father at a very early age, so he also had to take care of his younger brother Francesco.

 FEE_Venice_Events.21.T: "Treachery of Jacopo?"
 FEE_Venice_Events.21.D: "My son Jacopo, the only one that survived the Peste of 1430s has already been accused of treachery against the Republic when on 18 February 1445, the Council of Ten imprisoned him on the charge of colluding with foreign princes. Foscari, however, had managed to save himself by fleeing to Trieste. Two days later the Ten banished him from Venice in perpetuity, condemning him to exile in Nauplia. The super-command Marco Trevisan was then sent to Trieste to execute the sentence and on 3 March the Dogaressa was forbidden to travel to Julian city to visit her son. In fact, according to historical documents, it seems that the Council had acted with a certain mildness perhaps due to pressure from the doge and his family. The Trevisan left for Trieste no earlier than 25 February and in any case did not succeed in capturing the Foscari since on 11 March the doge was asked to induce his son to turn himself in. In the following months, the Dieci was substantially inert and only on 28 November 1446 was the confinement at Nauplia converted with that at Zelarino, a Venetian locality very close to the Lagoon of which the Foscari were feudal lords. Finally, on 13 September 1447, the Dieci granted a pardon. \n\nA today the Ten came back to deal with him: he was now accused of entertaining correspondence with Francesco Sforza and even Muhammad II. On 12 June, therefore, the super-committee Lorenzo Loredan was sent to Chania. He brought Foscari back to Venice where, on 24 July, the Council gave him the mildest sentence, i.e. confirmation of his Cretan exile. The doge and the young man's family were also allowed to visit him in prison."

A state funeral was arranged for him with an exhibition to the people in ducal vestments, despite the opposition of his widow, who saw it as a clumsy act of reparation by that power that had taken away her son and humiliated her husband. The body was accompanied by the new doge [Root.Monarch.GetName] who appeared in the simple guise of a senator. Francesco Foscari was buried in the presbytery of the basilica of the Frari, in the mausoleum made for him by Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino, in an urn supported by four graceful corbels adorned with the three theological virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity) in whose arrangement around the sarcophagus Niccolò modified the conventional and static arrangement of the personifications, transforming it into a drama inserted in the flow of time. The crowning figure of the Saviour changed the common motif of the Risen Christ into the image of the Ascension of Christ taken from the Venetian duchy, as an allusion to the true ruler of Venice, to whom alone his representative - the doge - was responsible."
