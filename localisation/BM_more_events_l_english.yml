 FEE_Ansbach_Events.1.D:0 "While the Duchy of Franconia has long fallen into disuse, our family still holds significant lands in the area. The Margraviates of Ansbach and Bayreuth have long since enjoyed independence, away from our crown's influence. In order to secure our vested interests in the area and protect its people from foreign invasions, we should secure and press our legitimate claims on the surrounding areas by any means necessary, starting with the city of Nuremberg. Such an act will certainly be viewed as hostile and therefore we should be vigilant when it comes to approaching this delicate matter."

This newfound prosperity propelled Nuremberg to a new height of success and profitability. Due to their influence as a centre of Germany, Emperor $EMPERORNAME$ saw fit to award them the title of "Free City", placing its walls and citizens under the Empire's protection. Despite these hurdles however, we must decide on whether we will press our claim on the city despite having our previous attempts rebuked, or abandon our plans altogether and maintain the status quo."

 FEE_Ansbach_Events.12.T:0 "Demands Refused!"
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.12.D:0 "The Bishop of Wurzburg has rejected our humble request for the role of head of the Franconian Circle, and has insulted in reprisal. Bearing an insult alone is plenty, but the shame of serving a tyrannical bishop is a burden too large to endure. Summon the banner, rally the men, and invite the captains; it is time to seize what is rightfully ours!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.1.T:0 "The Assassination of Pedro de Arbués"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.1.D:0 "Having seen many religious practices spread across the peninsula since the time of the Romans, Iberia was traditionally a place of tolerance and coexistence. However, in 1478 Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon received permission from the Pope to establish the national Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition to replace the papal Inquisition of the middle ages.\n\nOne of the first officers of the Spanish Inquisition was Pedro de Arbués, who relentlessly pursued heretics and \"conversos\", Jews who had received baptism, but who were often suspected of still practicing Judaism. In 1484, his efforts earned him the position as the Inquisitor Provincial of the Kingdom of Aragon.\nIn Aragon, the Inquisition immediately became unpopular, as it was seen as an attack on the provinces' autonomy. Combined with Arbués' pursuit of influential converso families, he quickly attracted notoriety, and on the 14th of September 1485, he was attacked while attending mass.\nThe presence of conversos among the assailants sparked a movement against Jews, which saw more than twenty executions."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.1.OPT1:0 "Arbués was a true man of faith!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.1.OPT2:0 "The Inquisition has gone too far already."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.2.T:0 "The War in Ribagorza"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.2.D:0 "Following brewing tensions in the county of Ribagorza, the peasants have now risen against their count. They claim that the Count Ribagorza is not their legitimate ruler, and that they should be ruled directly by the Crown. While this is most flattering for our ruler, agreeing to the peasants' demands would greatly upset the nobles of the region."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.2.OPT1:0 "These peasants are loyal servants of the Crown."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.2.OPT2:0 "The feudal order must be upheld!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.3.T:0 "Alteraciones de Aragón"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.3.D:0 "In 1578 Antonio Pérez, long the trusted advisor of King Philip, had his political enemy Juan de Escobedo stabbed to death in a back alley in Madrid, following several clumsy attempts at poisoning him. Although the king originally approved of the plan, he started to question Pérez's motives, and in 1579 arrested him. Many years would pass before Pérez managed to escape to Aragon.\nThere he made himself subject to the regional laws, the fueros, before going on trial before the justice of Aragon. As the court sided with Pérez, the king withdrew his accusation, but presented a new one through his official representative in Aragon. This time Pérez was sentenced to death, but ensured his safety by appealing to the notion that the king was overstepping his bounds and not respecting Aragon's sovereignty.\nAfter the legal process continued to drag on, the king tried to bypass the justice of Aragon by accusing Antonio Pérez of heresy through the Inquisition. As bypassing Aragonese law and custom was exactly what had angered the Aragonese enough to keep Pérez alive, they rose up in revolt. A fed up King Philip invaded Aragon - formally his own domain - with Castilian troops, and put the chief justice to death without trial as a statement of authority.\n\nAntonio Pérez had already escaped to France and later England, and would die of natural causes in 1611."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.6.D:0 "A miracle! The Blessed Virgin Mary has healed a man! Miguel Pellicer had his leg amputated two and a half years ago, and unable to work the fields he took to begging, but every night he would ask the priests at the Sanctuary of the Pillar for some oil to rub his leg, believing this to be a way to call upon the favor of the virgin. It must have worked, for this past Easter, Pellicer woke up one day with both his legs!\nNow, following a lengthy inquiry by priests and doctors, the archbishop of Zaragoza has pronounced it a true miracle!

 FEE_Aragon_Events.7.T:0 "Constructing the Canal Imperial de Aragón"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.7.D:0 "For centuries, travel and trade through the Aragonese inland has relied on the river Ebro. Its waters are unpredictable in the Iberian heat however, so our royal engineers have designed a canal, using techniques imported from elsewhere in Europe to bind our country closer together.\nUnder the direction of the cleric Ramón Pignatelly, they are ready to begin their great project."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.8.D:0 "After years of work, the canal has finally opened for boat travel. Already shipments are brought between Zaragoza and Navarra in far greater quantities than before. This lets us export Zaragozan wares across the Atlantic and to Northern Europe, and Navarran goods to the Mediterranean. Our nation is sure to prosper from this revolutionary waterway!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.9.T:0 "The Ciudadela de Jaca"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.9.D:0 "The many wars with the enemies to the north has proven time and again that Jaca is of utter strategic importance.\n\nWatching over one of the few crossroads of the Pyrenees, it is key to the defense of the kingdom. We should build a citadel to exert our power."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.9.OPT2:0 "Hire the best engineer that can be found."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.10.T:0 "A Foreign Viceroy"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.10.D:0 "As Aragon and Castile were to be equals under the Spanish crown, but the King of the two countries hailed from Castile, the ancient laws and practices of Aragon had a special protected status. These stated that if the country should be ruled by a viceroy appointed by a foreign king, he must be Aragonese.\n\nAs this practice safeguards the people of Aragon from foreign influence, it contributed to the stability of the union. However, it would not be long before the foreign king appointed a viceroy from his own inner circle, rather than listen to the nobles of Aragon."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.10.OPT1:0 "Let our overlord appoint whoever they wish."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.10.OPT2:0 "Ensure an Aragonese viceroy."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.11.T:0 "Jeronimo Zurita"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.11.D:0 "Jeronimo de Zurita y Castro was a an Aragonese historian born in 1512. Born in Zaragoza, he studied in Castile and under Hellenist teachers, developed his ideas of history. Eventually he would become the official chronicler of the Kingdom of Aragon in 1548. He defined a new historic practice, where the Archives of Aragon alone were not enough, but sources from Rome, Naples and Sicily had to be referenced and compared to create a fuller historical picture of events. Eventually he resigned to dedicate himself to the \"Anales de la Corona de Aragon,\" which would stand the test of time as a central authority on the history of Spain."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.11.OPT1:0 "Employ him."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.12.T:0 "Miguel Servet"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.12.D:0 "Miguel Servet was a Spanish renaissance polymath, both a very noteable physician and theologian. He also made advancements in mathematics, astronomy and geography, along with writing poetry and interpreting the Bible. He was a perfect Renaissance man, any king's dream citizen, except for that last one.\nAs the Protestant Reformation spread across Europe, Servet challenged his own faith and found new truths in the Bible. However, he found both Lutheranism lacking, and even clashed directly with Calvin over his ideas of predestination. In the end, the letters he sent to Calvin proved fatal, as the reformer sent them to Catholic authorities to oust Servet as a heretic. Escaping from France to Italy, Servet stopped in Geneva to hear his opponent preach. Servet was arrested by the reformists however, and in an attempt to prove the orthodoxy of his movement, Calvin pushed to have him executed before Servet's Catholic pursuers could catch up to him.\n\nWithout this unfortunate end, Miguel Servet might have been the source of a reform movement of his own."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.12.OPT1:0 "Who cares about his beliefs, the man is a genius!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.12.OPT2:0 "Hunt him down!"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.13.T:0 "Michael Servetus tried in $PROVINCE$"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.13.D:0 "Michael Servetus was a Spanish physician and scholar, an archetypical Renaissance man. However, his interpretation of the bible brought him into conflict with not just the catholics of Spain and France, but also the established reform movements of Lutheranism and Calvinism.\n\nNow, while on the run from Catholic authorities, he passed through $PROVINCE$, in the hopes of seeing one of our great reformers speak. However, his heretical views on predestination have led to him being arrested by them too, and now he is set to be executed for his beliefs."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.13.OPT1:0 "This man is a danger to every Christian!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.13.OPT2:0 "Intervene. He seems to have some interesting ideas."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.14.T:0 "Baltasar Gracián"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.14.D:0 "Baltasar Gracián was a Spanish writer and philosopher in the first half of the 17th century. He became a Jesuit and an army chaplain, but a lot of his practices were frowned upon by his superiors. However, he continued in reading letters sent from Hell as a form of preaching and publishing unapproved books, the most famous of which is the masterpiece of Spanish literature known as \"El Criticon\". Despite continuing to have trouble with his religious order, he became the defining voice of Baroque literature in Spain, and the main representative of the literary tradition of Conceptism."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.14.OPT1:0 "His wit and thoughtfulness will be popular at court."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.14.OPT2:0 "Let him write. His religious order can deal with him."

However, if the project is to continue, the rest of the Royal Council will have to be convinced."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.16.OPT1:0 "Make the council support the project."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.16.OPT2:0 "Is this spending really wise?"

 FEE_Aragon_Events.17.T:0 "Responsibility for the Construction Project"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.17.D:0 "The Count of Aranda has entrusted the new channel project to the clergy, especially the bishop Ramón Pignatelli. His mind is swift and he seems to embrace new Enlightenment ideas. He advocates for new financial institutions for the poor, cultural patronage of the arts, and for reforming both education and the economy."
 FEE_Aragon_Events.17.OPT1:0 "This is the man to lead the construction of the channel!"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.17.OPT2:0 "Maybe we should pick someone less... passionate."

 FEE_Aragon_Events.18.T:0 "Pignatelli Upsets Colleagues"
 FEE_Aragon_Events.18.D:0 "Pignatelli has upset his colleagues with his new ideas. In order to get more funds, he granted exemptions from Church taxes next to the new channel.

 FEE_Austria_Events.1.D:0 "The reforms presented at the Diet of Worms in 1495 was the Emperor Maximilian I's attempt at centralising the Holy Roman Empire. The most lasting of these reforms was the establishment of the Reichskammergericht, which would function as the Empire's highest court, along with an imperial ban on internal feuding, the Ewiger Landfriede.\n\nMaximilian also established an Imperial government, the \"The Reichsregiment,\" which was separate from the emperor's court. This was intended to efficiently administrate the Empire as a whole, even outside of the Imperial Diet. It would represent every princedom in the Empire, but never fully managed to assume its position of power, and was dissolved in 1502."

They both claimed the Hungarian and Bohemian throne, they mistrusted each other, they both were eager to dominate southeastern Europe - thus saw each other as their greatest obstacle - and they were contrary characters, Friedrich patient, contemplative, fatalistic and sometimes phlegmatic, Matthias determined, ambitious and aggressive. Thus the peace concluded between Poland, Bohemia and Hungary in 1477 did not include Friedrich. The rivalry between the two, before sparked by Friedrich suspecting Matthias of secretly allowing the Ottomans to invade Austria through Hungary and supporting Wladislas Jagiello as King of Bohemia against the claims of Matthias, deteriorated into a personal feud. On the battlefield, Matthias Corvinus got the upper hand, swiftly defeated Friedrich even after he had gathered an Imperial army and invaded his hereditary lands. Within 5 years, Matthias' army reduced Frederick's strongholds one by one. The Emperor was deeply humiliated and his defeat evident in 1485 when Hungarian armies captured Vienna and he had to flee to Linz. In the last years of his life he was deeply depressive due to this shame. Vienna was only recaptured by his son Maximilian."

Over the course of the 16th and 17th century, so-called \"Barbary Corsairs\" were one of the greatest threats to Christian ships in the Mediterranean, and their dreadful raids prevented most settlement along the coast of Spain and Southern Italy. \n\nDistant naval expeditions are challenging however, and impossible without a port to call home. We have been approached by a group of pirates who wish to enter into a privateer contract with us, and use one of our ports as their base of operations.\nIn addition to harassing the coastal settlements of the infidels of Europe, they promise they will be bringing a wealth of taken goods and slaves through our lands."

However Matthias Corvinus died of a stroke before the matter was definitely secured, and the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Matthias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'.

Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490 and immediately thereafter accepted the compact of Farkashida in which he confirmed all existing privileges of the nobility and took back all legal and administrative reforms, including the efficient system of taxation regarded as repressive by the magnates. After 3 decades of prosperity and modernisation, the election of Vladislav initiated a rapid decline, ending up in the disaster of Mohacs. Another candidate to the throne was Maximilian of Habsburg who maintained the claim of his father Friedrich III, but since he had already proven to be a capable ruler and would have been likely to use his powerbase in the Empire, Austria and Burgundy to consolidate his authority in Hungary, he was no popular choice.

 FEE_Denmark_Events.1.D:0 "The union of Sweden under Denmark was an unstable one, and only a strong Danish ruler could keep Sweden under their thumb. In 1520, King Christian went as far as to lead a military intervention in Sweden. Successful in his endeavour, Christian was anointed and swore the traditional oath to only appoint natural-born Swedes to the governing of the country. A great banquet was held in Stockholm in his honor, lasting several days. Then, on the 7th of November, the massacre began.\nThe king summoned many prominent Swedish officials and politicians to a private conference in the castle. Once there they were well received, but the king's hospitality only went so far. Soon Danish soldiers arrived with torches and axes and took them capture. Over the following day, more than 80 nobles, clergymen and politicians would be executed under the pretense of heresy. \n\nWhile intended to bring Sweden to its knees before Denmark, the executions had the opposite effect, and was the event that sparked the Swedish War of Liberation that permanently ended the union."

 FEE_Denmark_Events.3.D:0 "Born in 1494, Tausen became a priest on the eve of the Protestant Reformation. He went to Wittenberg in 1523, and was convinced by Lutheran principles. Upon his return to Denmark he started preaching the Lutheran faith, and he found many listening ears. He left the official church and made a practice of preaching from the church tower in Viborg. When he was denied the right to preach in the church, his followers broke in and forced a compromise where catholic priests would preach in the morning, and Tausen in the afternoon. The bishop has found this unacceptable, so he sent armed men to imprison the rogue priest. That hasn't helped, however, as large crowds now gather outside the window of his cell to hear him preach! \n\nIn time Hans Tausen would go on to become the foremost theologian of the Danish Reformation, but for now we must decide what to do with this heretic!"

He was imprisoned, but King Frederick I saw an opportunity. Interested in Lutheran ideas himself, particularly the ones about rulers receiving the church's property, he placed Tausen under his protection and named him court chaplain. As the Danish Reformation continued to spread, Tausen was called to preach in Copenhagen. The protestants became more and more confrontational against the catholic priests, and once King Fredrik died and Tausen was tried for heresy, a mob rose to attack the bishop of Copenhagen, ensuring Tausen's safety, who in turn protected the bishop from murder by mob.\nOnce Denmark officially converted to Protestantism, Tausen was appointed bishop of Ribe. During his twenty years in that position, he continued to direct much of the still developing protestant faith in Denmark."

While his reforms were initially well-received, they soon became unpopular as they seemed to go against Danish values and traditions for the sake of abstract concepts of liberty.

 FEE_Denmark_Events.24.D:0 "Throughout the Middle Ages, Danish earls and other nobles sought to limit the power of the Kings of Denmark, who had been a very strong and sometimes outright tyrannical ruler during the early days of the Danish Kingdom. \nThe Riksråd, or Council of the Realm, was first mentioned in the 1320s. By the 1440s it had become known as main opponent of royal power. In general, they maintained a healthy balance of power, electing the kings of Denmark in exchange for giving certain lucrative revenues to the King. The nobles in turn generally protected the rights of the common people from excessive taxation, and took on much of the administration of the realm.\nWith the loss of the Kingdom of Sweden, however, came a break in the balance of power. The heavy losses suffered by royal armies and treasury as well as the loss of prestige gave them the opportunity to seize more power for themselves. They now demand that the King sign a haandfæstning, a document guaranteeing noble privileges as a condition of the nobility's acceptance of the King's continued rule. Among the new rights\nthey demand is the right to revolt against any King that does not keep all promises, written or spoken, to the noble estate. Failure to sign this document, they warn, will force the nobility to invoke Denmark's ancient elective monarchy, in which the de facto recognition of hereditary rule will be abolished and a new King sought from elsewhere…"

 FEE_Denmark_Events.25.D:0 "While the nobles have been more influential in Denmark, Norway's status as a junior partner has robbed their nobility of much of their power to restrain the king. Furthermore, Norway's status as a true hereditary monarchy, rather than Denmark's de jure elective monarchy, meant that the powers of the Norwegian Riksråd diminished over time rather than strengthened. Soon they served as little more than councils in the case of regency. \nIn 1536, King Christian III of Denmark-Norway, in response to a bishop-led rebellion against his efforts to convert Norway to Lutheranism, finally abolished the Norwegian Riksråd, which never assembled again."

As one of the leading Lutheran rulers, then, [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Denmark looked on anxiously as the clouds of religious war gathered over Germany, although he did not formally join the league.

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.D:0 "As the Reformation and printing press sweep mainland Europe in tandem, here in England the Bible has been no stranger to the English tongue. Indeed, as far back as 1382 the Bible was translated into English by John Wycliffe. In more recent times, translations from the continent have started to arrive, and the first printed English Bible was produced by William Tyndale in 1525.\n\nHowever, the Wycliffe Bible is outdated and thus difficult to read; the continental translations are too full of notes (some of which run contrary to our own beliefs!) to be useful, and Tyndale's Bible is incomplete.\n\nTo this end, $MONARCH$ has summoned a conference at a royal palace in Hampton Court, including scholars, theologians from every protestant sect in England, and even playwrights and printers. Of this motley crew, who shall be primarily entrusted with the Word of God?"

Not only is it a uniform translation, but one done with such literary excellence that many scholars consider it stylistically superior to the Greek original!\n\nWhile the finished product may be magnificent, that did not, however, prevent several errors on the part of the printers. One particularly embarrassing error, quickly dubbed the Wicked Bible to riotous laughter among the populace, omitted the word “not” from one of the Ten Commandments. The result? “Thou shalt commit adultery.” Of course this defect was quickly corrected, but what shall be done with such a miscreant printer?"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.4.D:0 "With the subjugation of Scotland all but completed and with the reigning in of Ireland well underway, the Acts of Union seek to formalize this unification de jure by claiming the mantle of the ancient Roman name of Britannia. However, while England is by far the largest and most powerful of the three British crowns of England, Scotland, and Ireland, a lasting union cannot be maintained simply with England alone while ignoring the others. As the Romans did before us, the Celtic fringe of Britannia is simply too proud and tumultuous to be ignored, and perhaps unable to be controlled by military means alone.\n\nTo the end of preserving a stable union, the Acts of Union have been proposed, creating a co-equal union rather than a purely English-dominated empire, in which Scottish and Irish concerns would both be heard. Doing this would keep the individuals kingdom's commotions from destabilizing the land as a whole."

Their biggest grievances with us include our toleration of Catholics and other heretics, as well as what they view as materialism and hedonism within the church.\n\nTheir influence is magnified by the fact that many of their followers come from within the emerging middle and merchant classes."

Turn our debt into payable securities to be sold in exchange for stock in their new trading company, dubbed the South Seas Company, which would receive a crown monopoly on all trade in the “South Seas.” What exactly the South Seas are was never really defined anywhere, but the agents of the Company assure us that our share of Company stock would make us more money than we could dream of needing to pay off our debt.\n\nIt all seems rather confusing, and nothing has been specified or promised on paper.

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.3.D:0 "While many enlightenment thinkers are critical of monarchies, and many monarchs are suspicious of enlightened ideals, there are those who realise the enlightened path is the way of the future. Ideas developed by modern philosophers can aid our bureaucracy and lend even greater legitimacy to our absolute rule. On the other hand, some of them speak of terrifying things like self-determination and pluralistic governments."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.T:0 "Supporting the Scientific Revolution"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.D:0 "In our modern day and age, the methods of the natural scientists of antiquity are coming up short. No longer is thinking and imagining the universe enough to discover the truth. Instead, self-styled \"scientists\" have begun developing strict methodologies to ensure that the theories they posit can be tested and developed. \nIt is undeniable that this has led to some incredible advances, but although they CLAIM to be thoroughly tested, the fact is that many \"scientific\" discoveries seem to go against clerical teaching."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.OPT1:0 "Knowing the truth means holding the advantage. We will support them, for $COUNTRY$!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.5.D:0 "Following the development of new scientific practices, and greater emphasis on certainty even over sensibility, great new discoveries about our world seems to be made every other day. The human body, physics and even mathematics does not always work the way one would think, and our support for academic institutions and prolific scientists has helped greatly."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.6.D:0 "With many other countries in Europe actively supporting new developments in the eternal search for human knowledge, our insistence on adherence to the time-tested old ways means that most significant discoveries are being made elsewhere. If we do not act, $COUNTRY$ risks falling behind in crucial areas like irrigation or military ideas."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.10.D:0 "In a display of contempt for order, an Enlightenment philosopher has loudly voiced criticisms of our [Root.GovernmentName] in the public sphere. While it is abundantly clear to anyone that our ways of doing things are superior to anything found elsewhere on the continent or in the world, it is simply not good enough for this philosopher. \nWe could have ignored the criticism, of course, but for some reason people seem to be listening to the philospher, and agreeing with certain points."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.12.T:0 "Military Thought Suffers Under Rationalism"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.12.D:0 "With the scientific concepts of empiricism and knowledge spreading into diverse ideologies as rationalism, thinkers are starting to consider many widely accepted military practices as downright barbaric. With public opinion turning against the less savoury aspects of war and bloodshed, military innovation develops slower than it should. Indeed, some even hold pacifist dreams of abolishing warfare althogether, replacing warriors with diplomats."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.T:0 "Rationalism Aids Trade"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.D:0 "With the development of rationalist ideas, thinkers have considered the way we have been doing trade for centuries, and found them lacking.

Some of these ideas seem like they could be quite beneficial!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.T:0 "Mercantilism Questioned"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.D:0 "For centuries we have adhered to the idea that our country needs to build up treasury reserves by always exporting more value than we import. While this leads to high tariffs that can sometimes contribute to famine and goods shortages, it always ensured we had cash at hand.\nHowever, the new idea seems to be that mercantilism often worsens economic downturns, and reduces the value of our national goods in the long term. While this idea is counterintuitive and quite frankly sounds ridiculous, it has enough supporters to be worth consideration."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.15.D:0 "While human universalism and occasionally even pacifism are observable among a large number of thinkers in our country, occasionally one of them will do something useful by making a realisation about military doctrine. Whether it is a technological advancement, a logistical development, or a deeper understanding of soldiers and the execution of warfare, we welcome every new idea that can help us defeat the enemies lurking at our doorstep."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.16.D:0 "In a recent pamphlet that has just started circulation, a prominent and - more dangerously - popular philosopher has explained in detail why the war our nation is fighting can be seen as unjust.

Radicals are singing their beliefs in the streets, and state soldiers are viewed with distrust. There hasn't been an open revolt yet, but so many philosophers seem to be trying to instigate exactly that.\nTheir aim is to replace our well-functioning institutions with inefficient liberal bastardisations.

 FEE_France_Events.1.T: "French Feudalism and the Hundred Years' War"
 FEE_France_Events.1.D: "In many of its aspects the institution of feudalism that defined medieval European life had its origins in France. During the 11th century, however, the “French Feudal Revolution” gave French feudalism a bewildering complexity that existed nowhere else in Europe, as holdings got broken down into ever smaller parts under the emergent classes of seigneurs and castellons. Some regions, such as Toulouse, were brought to heal, but most regions remained largely ruled by small powers with little control from Paris. \n\nThe agony of the Hundred Years' War only increased the confusion, as allegiances between the various vassals fluctuated between the Valois and Plantagenet claimants to the throne. The expense of the war left France unable to enforce feudal obligations on several more prominent vassals, but also underlined the need for centralization to mount an effective defense against foreign aggression. To truly centralize France, however, centuries of tradition, laws, and feudal contracts would, sooner or later, need to be disregarded or destroyed…"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT1: "We must centralize the Kingdom of France!"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT2: "We should remind our vassals of their military obligations!"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT3: "France is too vast to govern, we must preserve the feudal system!"

 FEE_France_Events.2.T:0 "Law Courts and Parlements"
 FEE_France_Events.2.D:0 "Power in France does not solely lie with the nobility, who exercise varying levels of independence from Paris. The rising class of lawyers, themselves centered in Paris, conduct much of the administration of the country with little oversight by the monarchy. Due to the inadequate road system, the further away from Paris the courts are, the less they tend to listen to the king. A properly unified administration of the nation must, of course, start here."
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT1:0 "We shall reign them in by any means necessary!"
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT2:0 "Let us seek to reason with them, perhaps they will help us on their own"
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT3:0 "§GLet the King Himself negotiate with these men§!"

 FEE_France_Events.3.T:0 "Regional Identities in France"
 FEE_France_Events.3.D:0 "France in the early modern period was a vast and populous land, by some measures the largest and most populous realm in the Western World, and certainly the largest to be claimed by one hereditary monarch, as opposed to the elective monarchy of the more populous but divided Holy Roman Empire. Despite the greater political unity, people in the various regions of France clung to their local identities rather than considering themselves Frenchmen, especially further away from the capital."
 FEE_France_Events.3.OPT1:0 "It is time we create a France for the French! "
 FEE_France_Events.3.OPT2:0 "Let the provincials be themselves, I don't care"

 FEE_France_Events.4.T:0 "Paris Seeks Control"
 FEE_France_Events.4.D:0 "Now that the war with England is finally over, instead of resting on their victory, it seems the French king has decided to curtail our God-given rights as local rulers and impose his own autocratic will on us. Needless to say, as semi-independent nobles in France, it falls to us to stand for the nobility across France and remind the King from whence his power comes."
 FEE_France_Events.4.OPT1:0 "We must send a delegation to Paris to assert our rights!"
 FEE_France_Events.4.OPT2:0 "There is nothing we can really do"

 FEE_France_Events.5.T:0 "French Feudal Lords Oppose the King"
 FEE_France_Events.5.D:0 "Seeking to preserve their long-standing feudal prerogatives, the nobility remains a powerful force that largely opposes the recent royal efforts at centralization. Our recent efforts at increasing royal control have caused a delegation of France's most powerful nobles, the semi-independent vassals of the crown, and others to approach the king and demand that our course be reversed."
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT1:0 "Ignore them!"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT2:0 "We can afford to reverse course a little"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT3:0 "Let us attempt to give carrots as well as sticks"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT4:0 "We must crush this arrogance now! "

 FEE_France_Events.6.T:0 "King Rejects our Demands"
 FEE_France_Events.6.D:0 "Our thinly veiled demand for protection of our rights and privileges was dismissed out-of-hand by the King in Paris. "
 FEE_France_Events.6.OPT1:0 "Perhaps it is time we show the king who really holds power in France…"
 FEE_France_Events.6.OPT2:0 "We cannot contend with the King of France"

 FEE_France_Events.7.T:0 "Noble Leaders Arrested!"
 FEE_France_Events.7.D:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, the French king has responded in the worst way possible to our demands. Arresting some leaders and having others secretly killed, most of the delegation to Paris will not be returning to their extensive land holdings any time soon…"
 FEE_France_Events.7.OPT1:0 "§Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! will rue the day!"

 FEE_France_Events.8.T:0 "The Second Estate"
 FEE_France_Events.8.D:0 "While the nobility of France keep much of the King's attention due to their vast land holdings and military power, the clergy are equally a political force to be reckoned with. At times the French clergy have controlled upwards of 40% of the nation's wealth in endowments that under French law could only increase, never decrease. The French Crown did, at least wrest the power to appoint bishops and cardinals during the medieval Investiture crisis, but the clergy are also a more unified force in opposition to the king than the often-squabbling nobility. If [Root.Monarch.GetName] can leverage what concessions he already has, he can overcome the clergy's resistance to centralization. If not…"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT1:0 "Seize Clergy Land and Curtail their Influence!"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT2:0 "Negotiate to gain their support for royal power"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT3:0 "Do not disturb the clergy"

 FEE_France_Events.9.T:0 "Clergy Refuses!"
 FEE_France_Events.9.D:0 "Our attempts at negotiating with the church have been met with arrogant dismissal at the hands of the leading clergymen of the realm. Saying that “your power comes from God just as ours does,” they refuse to relinquish any of their political power in our realm. In response to our attempts to use investiture to leverage influence, they have reignited the feud between church and king over the right to appoint church officials."
 FEE_France_Events.9.OPT1:0 "Ingrates!"
 FEE_France_Events.9.OPT2:0 "This has gone far enough - the King of France rules the church!"

 FEE_France_Events.10.T:0 "Clergy Accepts"
 FEE_France_Events.10.D:0 "Our overtures were accepted by the Second Estate! Whether through respect for the divine rule of the king, or from fear of the king's power over investiture, prominent clerics led a ceremony of reaffirmation of the French king's authority over the church."
 FEE_France_Events.10.OPT1:0 "Wonderful!"

 FEE_France_Events.11.T:0 "Re-Trial of Jeanne D'Arc"
 FEE_France_Events.11.D:0 "In the year 1429, the Hundred years war was still raging on. With much of Northern France under the Anglo-Burgundian alliance, France was in a weak position. That same year, a peasant girl named Jeanne D'Arc, instructed by voices of angels, went into the royal court of Chinon where king Charles VII, along with many military leaders, to Orleans in order to defeat the English. In the ensuing battle, she earned the nickname 'Maid of Orleans'. Later on in her life, she helped the king be crowned at Reims, and led an unsuccessful attack to reclaim the city of Paris. In the year 1431, she was captured by the Burgundians who sold her to the English, and she was trialed and executed in the city of Rouen.\n\nNow, with the support of the Pope, the university of Paris, and the city of Rouen at our hand, the trial has been re-done, with over 115 witnesses testifying of the maid's purity. This will eliminate any claims that the kingdom was reclaim using a sorceress, thus removing any threats of undermining our legitimacy."
 FEE_France_Events.11.OPT1:0 "The English fops have been beaten once again."

 FEE_France_Events.12.T:0 "The Bourgeoisie Request Concessions"
 FEE_France_Events.12.D:0 "While the nobility and clergy estate have historically been the most powerful in France, the support of the bourgeoisie has always been vital to shore up royal support both within Paris, by far the largest urban center of France, and the outlying cities. The cities, which provide much of the trade wealth of France, bend the knee to neither nobles nor priests. Thus, the bourgeoisie, also known as the Third Estate, controls a disproportionate amount of the wealth that reaches the King's coffers. \nWord of our recent efforts at tighter administration have reached the towns dominated by the Third Estate. They are worried about their rights and privileges that make their cities attractive for trade and business in the first place, and that the crown might seek to repeal them."
 FEE_France_Events.12.OPT1:0 "They are nothing but lowborns! We govern as we wish!"
 FEE_France_Events.12.OPT2:0 "We can't do anything against them"

 FEE_France_Events.13.T:0 "Conflict Between King and Cities"
 FEE_France_Events.13.D:0 "The Third Estate has decidedly split with the royal authority in Paris over the crown's refusal to continue guaranteeing their rights and privileges. Much of France's small but growing urban population is now suspicious of every move the King makes that might threaten their freedoms. Their fears have caused them to seek support from the outlying dukes and princes of the French periphery. Some bourgeoisie have approached us offering financial support and men. By joining their own resources with ours, we can present a united front against any encroachment from Paris."
 FEE_France_Events.13.OPT1:0 "We thank them for their support!"
 FEE_France_Events.13.OPT2:0 "What they say is treason, enough of this!"

 FEE_France_Events.14.T:0 "A Regular Army"
 FEE_France_Events.14.D:0 "Throughout the feudal world, the social order could be simplified as “those who fought for all (the nobility), those who prayed for all (the clergy), and those who worked for all (everyone else).” In the 1400s this social order seemed as strong as ever, but in practice warfare was often much less idealistic. The strain on the feudal levies caused by the Hundred Years' War caused the French king to rely ever more heavily on mercenaries. These ragtag armies were often poorly disciplined and cruel to the populace they were supposed to protect. \n\nIn 1445, in the aftermath of the Surrender of Maine, the first real attempt was made to reorganize the army, but mercenaries still dominated the battlefield. Those fiefs ruled directly by the Crown are more than adequate to supply a large standing army if the Crown were to institute more rigorous recruiting; however, the manpower of our vassals is not to be underestimated; nor are the consequences of demanding too much from the French peasantry in the place of mercenaries."

 FEE_France_Events.15.D:0 "The Dukes of Provence have proven mightily ambitious in recent years, claiming every vacant throne from Aragon to Jerusalem. When all is said and done, however, they are nothing but a mere scion of the Valois dynasty which rules France, the greatest crown in Europe outside the Emperor himself. This junior part of the family has managed to secure itself de jure French possessions far and wide, has proclaimed themselves a kingdom, and even claims as core territory land that is our own core territory! \n\nNeedless to say, the lofty ambitions of this cadet branch threaten to interfere with ours. While the Anjou princes have tried their best to maintain good relations, perhaps it is in our best interest to reconsider their alliance with us..."

 FEE_France_Events.16.T:0 "The Breton Question"
 FEE_France_Events.16.D:0 "While the Bretons were included in the old Carolingian Empire, the last bastion of Celtic presence in mainland Europe was quick to regain it's independence. Gifted with deft diplomats, they negotiated our respect for their sovereignty in exchange for neutrality in the Hundred Years' War. Now that the English have been evicted from France, however, this promise of neutrality is no longer relevant. More relevant is the promise of the treaty that Brittany will swear fealty and tribute to the rightful King of France. \n\nTreaty or not, the fact remains that the Bretons occupy land that is rightfully part of the French crown. Whether we choose to act on our legal rights, however, depends on the diplomatic consequences of doing so."

 FEE_France_Events.17.D:0 "In the Second Treaty of Guerande, we managed to stave off French attempts at annexing us by promising both neutrality in the Hundred Years' War and swearing a nominal fealty to France. Now, envoys from Paris have arrived, claiming that fealty be given. While not an overt demand at subjugation or annexation, it is a claim of overlordship and demand for tribute that weighs seriously on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s mind. Furthermore, the envoys of Paris claim that tribute must be paid, not only for this year but all the years since the treaty was signed over two generations ago."
 FEE_France_Events.17.OPT1:0 "We have no choice but to accept"

 FEE_France_Events.20.T:0 "Scottish Mercenaries"
 FEE_France_Events.20.D:0 "The ties between Scotland and France by 1444 were deep. In addition to the Auld Alliance, Scots have been travelling to France to serve as fighters in the relatively lucrative wars on the continent, seeking wealth and fame, as far back as Charlemagne. Scots mercenaries quickly became known in France for their strength and sometimes mad courage, fighting in several key battles of the Hundred Years' War. Many Scots even of noble blood found service in the French armies. \nA few of the best among the Scots were picked out by Charles VII in 1418 to serve as a special corps, first as frontline troops and later as his royal bodyguard. With our renewed focus on mercenary armies, it is only fair that we give this guard special consideration."

His exploits would eventually bring him into the service of the French king, for which he was granted the governorship of Aix-en-Provence. In 1553, however, during France's war with Genoa, Sampiero Corso returned to Corsica to lead a rebellion against the Genoese. Although he was successful in securing Corsica's allegiance to France, the island would be returned to Genoa in the peace treaty of Cateau Cambrésis between France and Spain in 1559."

 FEE_France_Events.23.T:0 "Sampiero Corso"
 FEE_France_Events.23.D:0 "Living from 1498 to 1567, Sampiero Corso was a Corsican lower noble and soldier. He grew up to become a condottieri, and fought for several paymasters in Italy. Eventually he came into the service of the French king, where his familiarity with Corsica became an advantage to the French efforts in Italy. \nNow it seems that our ruthless enemies in France has chosen to send Sampiero Corso in an attempt to free Corsica for later French occupation!"
 FEE_France_Events.23.OPT1:0 "Curse that man, and curse all the kings of France!"

 FEE_France_Events.22.T:0 "Poor Internal Toll System"
 FEE_France_Events.22.D:0 "In the 17th and 18th century, France had dozens of different laws for how different goods were to be taxed when transported between provinces. To make matters worse, different laws applied to different provinces, causing multiple tolls to be paid by merchants travelling across the country. Not only did this discourage trade and transportation, it made it so that it was often cheaper to import goods from abroad, rather than from a neighboring city.\nIt was also up to local signeurs to apply the taxation laws, which meant that there was no regulation on lords that charged far more than they legally should. In the middle of the 18th century, it was estimated that the cost of transporting 500 livres worth of wine from Muret to Paris was 501 livres, paying for dozens of tolls along the way. The provincial regulations meant that the same amount of salt could cost twenty times as much on one side of a river as on the other."

Adolf was supported by not only the fourmajor cities of Gelre, but also by the Duke of Burgundy.\n\nArnold was imprisoned, and his son seized power.

The Duke of Burgundy might be willing to pay a significant amount of gold to receive the right of inheritance of $COUNTRY$.

He seeks to become a strong Duke in his own right, competing with the influence of the Duke of Burgundy and the Habsburgs. \nHowever, Arnold's reign in Gelre itself is far from stable. His equally ambitious son, Adolf, while young, may yet try to have him removed, and the nobles and burghers of Gelre are hardly friendly to Arnold's ambitions either. \nGelre bring relatively poor among the Lowland realms means that an influx of cash may very well stabilize the situation and give the Duke of Gelre the boost he needs to project dominance over the surrounding princes.

His reputation for not paying back loans led to a shortage of funds for this ambitious project. Gelre, therefore, opted to allow its troops free rein to pillage and plunder in place of regular pay.

As the Bank of Saint George became a major creditor for Genoa, they acquired the right to collect taxes on Corsica, provided they also protected the island. \nWhile the bank treated Genoese settlers preferentially over locals, it did much to develop the island, especially the towns and fortifications along the coast. However, the bank's taxation would eventually grow to wear as heavily on the locals as the republic's had, and provided the driving force of the Corsican movement to replace Genoese authority with French."

Sunshine and warmth have been driven out of much of the world, replaced by incessant rainfall and constant fog. Worse, ice and frost have appeared in the height of summer hundreds of miles further south than it has ever been during summer. No one knows exactly what has caused this unusual year, although reports of a massive volcanic eruption in the East Indies seem to coincide with it. The effects, however, are worldwide. \nIn Asia, the monsoons were disrupted, causing floods in China and India, while in northern Europe the constant rain and low temperatures caused massive crop failures. In North America, grain crops failed and many were reduced to boiling herbs for sustenance. Around the world, a wave of cholera, typhus, and other diseases typically associated with poverty and starvation followed quickly on the heels of food shortages. \nPrices have risen dramatically as desperate people are willing to sell their very souls for bread, even as many lose their homes and are reduced to begging. Large estates, many already in debt from lavish living, now teeter on the verge of bankruptcy. The widespread shortages have led to a sharp increase in violence as rioters chanting “Bread or Blood” demand food that doesn't exist."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.D:0 "As the Spanish kingdoms focused on the southwards reconquest of Iberia against the Moors, the traditional northern heartland regions often became neglected. \nGalicia in particular became a hotbed of instability during the latter half of the 15th century, as noble and clerical power were evenly divided in the region, and the poor weather of the Little Ice Age hit Galicia's temperate climate especially hard. As the nobles and clergy squabbled for power, the peasants, lower nobility and merchants were increasingly oppressed, including outright banditry from the nobles and extortion from the priests. \nNow, the Galicians can stand it no longer. At first gathering in secret, the Irmandiños (brotherhood) have now armed the people, who have now risen up in revolt against their oppressors! Targeting the nobility in particular, they have already destroyed dozens of castles, and the nobility have now come to both us and the king of Portugal, desperate for our aid."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.D:0 "While not of one of the major noble families of Galicia, and even rumored to be a bastard, Pedro Madruga was a peerless example of the best of medieval knighthood in Galicia. While courteous, even-tempered, and polite, he was also a fierce warrior and became exceptionally skilled in all areas of warfare. Travelling between Castile and Portugal only facilitated his study of different and advanced battle techniques, both on land and at sea. \nDespite all this, he would never have become known were it not for the Irmandiños Revolts. He personally led the victorious royal and noble troops to victory, and was the first to introduce the early modern arquebus to northern Iberia, a factor which no doubt was vital to his victory."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.T:0 "The Autonomous Regions"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.D:0 "The question of the various constituent kingdoms of our realm has always been a nagging one for the Catholic monarchs of Iberia. The very fact that many of them were recognized by Popes past as kingdoms in their own right has been a source of contention, as nobility and peasant alike have felt unrepresented in our court, causing widespread resentment. \nWith the Reconquista complete, now is the time to reorganize these outlying regions. [Root.Consort.GetName] has recently come up with the idea of a national Cortes where each region has their own representation. [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, desiring increased power in these regions, would prefer a viceroyalty. This would allow some local rule while still maintaining a dependence on the crown. However, this likely would not satisfy the regions. Most radical of all would be either withdrawing royal authority or attempting to assert total control."

Being one of the oldest and most proud kingdoms of Christian Iberia, the former kingdom of Navarra stubbornly guarded its ancient institutions. \nAmong those was the Fueros, the royal charter of Navarra which not only gave Navarra kingdom rank but granted considerable autonomy to its nobles and guaranteed rights to its peasants. Now, representatives of these parties have approached us, requesting that we continue to respect these rights.

 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.D:0 "From it's very beginning as a march of the Carolingian Empire, Catalonia has diverged from the rest of Iberia in maintaining its unique laws and customs, some derived from Salic law, and some even from pre-Roman times. Over time, these customs were codified in the Usatges and later in the four great institutions of Catalonia. These were the Consell de Cent, Las Corts Generals, the Consulat del Mar, and the Generalitat de Catalunya, representing the nobility, lawyers, traders, and the general estates, respectively. \nThese institutions have been maintained even under the dominion of the crown of Aragon, and now the Catalonians petition us to continue their rights as well."

The Institutions of Catalonia have become a rallying standard for the preservation of rights in the face of royal absolutism. \nEven more infuriating to the Catalonians is the increasingly outward focus of the Spanish crown, with quests for the new world and domination of Europe leaving their Mediterranean-focused and trade-dependent cities behind. Now, the Catalonians are demanding their ancient rights be encoded in an inviolable Constitution, a thing heretofore unheard of in the Iberian kingdoms. \nIf we do not act quickly, this simmering resentment might boil into outright revolt.

 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.D:0 "[227.GetName] is in ruins! On All Saints' Day 1755, one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded struck just 200 kilometers off the coast of Portugal, rocking the nation completely. Portugal was typically earthquake-prone, [227.GetName] in particular having been severely damaged before in prior disasters. This earthquake proved to be like no other though, the death toll estimated to be about 40,000 and the great capital of Portugal destroyed, through earthquake, tsunami or fire. The earthquake itself was reported to have created crevices 5 metres wide in the city centre. Many retreated to the open spaces of the docks, to see the sea retreat to display a barren, muddy plain. Roughly an hour after the earthquake, a colossal tsunami ripped through [227.GetName] up the River Tejo, destroying all in its path. The shaking and shockwaves from the earthquake and its subsequent tsunami knocked over all varieties of candle and set the city ablaze, turning the already ruined city into a firestorm. \nBy the time the disaster was over, 85% of [227.GetName] was destroyed and countless works of art, literature, architecture and history were lost. King Joseph I and his court were, by sheer luck, out of [227.GetName] due to his daughter's wish to spend All Saints' Day away from the capital. King Joseph himself developed claustrophobia due to the tragedy, and was terrified of living within walls for the rest of his life, instead opting to move the court to a mass of tents on the outskirts of [227.GetName]. The prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal used this to gain power, leveraging the earthquake to take control of the royal court, and establish himself as the primary political figure in Portugal through his handling of the disaster."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.D:0 "Initially starting as a humble Franciscan friar, Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros was thrown in prison for his disagreements with the archbishop of Toledo (who is no stranger to meddling in our own affairs as well!). Upon his release, Jimenez devoted his life to reforming the church, gaining such a reputation for holiness that he became archbishop himself, as well as personal confessor of Isabella de Castilla and cardinal. \nConvoking long-overdue synods, Jimenez rooted out most, if not all, clerical corruption in Spain. Beyond this, however, he sponsored schools for the laity, oversaw the flooding of Castilian markets with translated devotional texts, and spread a new school of mystical through in clergy and laity alike. Essentially, his reforms were almost single-handedly responsible for reviving the piety of the Spanish people, purging corruption, and making Spain into the devout Catholic bastion of the early modern world, unlike any other in the world."

In addition, it harmonized Renaissance humanist ideas with solid Catholic dogma in a way no other clerical school did. During the Reformation years, it would grow to become a powerhouse of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, sending trained priests to hold back reformers in Ireland, France, and Italy as well as producing many missionaries for Spain's overseas territories."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.D:0 "Since at least the 8th century, the Catholic Popes have made repeated reference to the \"Donation of Constantine\" said to be an imperial decree of the ancient Emperor Constantine himself, giving the Pope political authority over Western Rome as well as spiritual power. \nIndeed, it is this very claim to authority under the doctrine of Translatio Imperii that provides legitimacy for the Holy Roman Empire itself! \nThe legitimacy of the Donation has been questioned since the 11th century for various reasons. Now, however, a philological scholar in our own court has completed a years-long analysis of what is said to be the source document for this sweeping claim to power. By pointing out linguistic inconsistencies, he makes a convincing proof that the document is, in fact, a reprehensible forgery. Indeed, the scholar, named Lorenzo Valla, claims the forgery is so obvious that even the current Pope must be complicit to use it so brazenly. \nMaking this known to the world, however, given the great importance that the Donation has assumed, would make a lot of enemies, and risks undermining the church itself! At the same time, it could shore up our own claims in Italy… \nPredictably, the Inquisition has demanded we turn Valla over to be tried for heresy. How shall we proceed?"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.D:0 "Building on the reforms of Jimenez de Cisneros, priest Juan de Avila became a staunch advocate for the reform of the clergy, almost forseeing the religious turmoil to come due to clergy corruption. Selling his entire inherited wealth to benefit the poor as an example, he undertook a remarkable journey as an itinerant preacher through Andalusia, ministering to the poor and railing against clergy abuses, especially the practice of nobility of setting up their children in a comfortable lifestyle as priests. Understandably them, his preaching of revival (recogimiento) led to resentment among some powerful families. \nNow, certain noble families have captured him and dragged him before the Royal Inquisition, demanding he recant and be silenced."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.14.D:0 "The oldest of all the monastic orders, the Benedictines have thrived throughout Europe, but especially in Spain. The independence of individual monasteries historically set them apart from their competitors and fostered a more austere and purer lifestyle, but it has also introduced disunity and confusion in their ranks. \nNow, as we confront the reformation, it is imperative that we assist these holy men in reaffirming their original vows and make the Order into a worthy example for our own more official holy orders."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.16.D:0 "The new Jesuit order founded by Ignatius de Loyola has taken both Catholics and Protestants by surprise with its new-found tenacity, zeal, and above all effectiveness. Unique among all holy orders was their vow to accept any and all missions given by the Pope in Rome. This combined with an acute awareness of the importance of Catholic education has made them the spearhead of the Counter-Reformation. Protestants have even taken to calling them the \"shock troops of the pope.\" Indeed, they have even become renowned experts of spycraft as they are trained to effortlessly blend in and evangelize even in kingdoms hostile to the Pope. \nTheir ambitious mission, to found Catholic schools all over Europe, and indeed the world, and staff those schools with the best and brightest minds in all fields, could potentially make them a potent force for us! However, as of now their ambitious outstrip their resources. Besides, with unmatched zeal and papal control and sanction comes great power, perhaps eventually too great for the Most Catholic Monarch of Spain to handle."

His treatise On the Harmony of the Free Will with the Gift of Grace, Divine Foreknowledge, Providence, Predestination, and Reprobation became the foundation for so-called \"Molinism,\" which though never officially approved by the Pope, has at least received Rome's tacit approval."

Additionally, as their success has grown, so to has their independence, and even the Pope to whom they still swear obedience exercises little control over them. \nNow, murmuring rumors about a sinister side of the Jesuits seem to have been borne out, a former Jesuit has brought to light a terrifying book, allegedly a compilation of carefully laid plans to overthrow monarchies throughout Europe and even destroy the Papacy itself! \nWhile it is unclear the extent to which this is true, it is true that the Jesuits' iron grip on childhood education gives it much power, and public opinion has started to shift decidedly against them. Even the Papacy is taking steps to condemn and possibly dismantle the Order."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.D:0 "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo was the first viceroy of Naples to effectively govern the kingdom on behalf of the Spanish crown. While issuing grand construction projects and modernizing the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government. \nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."

 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.100.D:0 "The little more than twenty-year-old King of France [FRA.Monarch.GetName], through his paternal grandmother, Maria of Anjou (1404-1463), claimed a distant hereditary right to the crown of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1492 he directed the resources of his kingdom towards the conquest of that realm, encouraged by Ludovico Sforza, called Il Moro (who was not yet Duke of Milan but was only its regent) and urged by his advisors, Guillaume Briçonnet and de Vers. \nThe reconquest of the largest kingdom of the Peninsula, already ruled by the House of Anjou (from 1282 to 1442), did not include, in the projects of [SPA.Monarch.GetName], Sicily. Through the conquest of the kingdom of Naples the king of France could have not simply increased the dominions of his House, an ambition common to many Middle-European or Anglo-Saxon ruling houses, but rather made them the starting point for those Crusades whose echo had been reinvigorated by the expulsion of the Arabs from the last Spanish possession, the Kingdom of Granada (1492). The political project of Res Publica Christiana Pro Recuperanda Terra Sancta still had a hold in the European aristocracies, even though the eight Crusades aimed at realizing it ended in disaster. The King of France himself, Louis IX, lost his life during the Eighth Crusade. Acre, the last Christian stronghold, fell definitively in 1291."

The Italian army was composed mostly of condottieri hired by Venice, with only a quarter of those being Milanese as their main force was preoccupied at Novara. They were led by the Marquise of Mantova, Gianfrancesco the Second Gonzaga. \nThe Italian forces compromised mostly of heavy nights, with support from light cavalry and stradioti from the Balkans, alongside a big host of infantry and a few artillery pieces, for a total of 20.000 men lead by many nobles from the grazing lands of Romagna, such as the leaders of Bologna, Rimini, Ferrara, and Urbino. \nThe french side was around half the size of the Italian League mostly composed of armoured knights and the host of Swiss mercenaries who composed the spearhead of the army and around 40 cannons for a little over 10.000 men.\nThe battle started with an artillery duel which was swiftly won by the French. The rain slowed down the advance of the League's main forces. The attack from the Milanese knights halted the swiss formation while the stradioti instead looted the baggage train. The rest of the army was able to cross the river while others deserted the charge due to the unfavourable terrain which lead to the Italian retreat. In just an hour, the French army lost around 1000 men and the baggage train, which had around 300.000 ducats of valuables in it, while the Italians lost around 3000 to 4000 men including many commanders."

Opposing him, presenting himself as an alternative, was [FRA.Monarch.GetName] of France, perhaps the most powerful man in Europe after the peace imposed on the Habsburgs and the Pope himself. Since the former owned Naples and the latter Milan, the election of the Emperor also became a decisive game for Italy.

The viceroy himself ordered that the synagogue be built in another place. The reason for this provision is to be found in the fact that the Savocese Jews, in officiating their rites, sang hymns in such a loud voice as to disturb the civil, judicial and liturgical activities of the Christians that took place a few steps from there. The confiscated synagogue was sold to a local Christian citizen, a certain Fulippu Sturiali who had to pay his fellow Jews a sum equal to ¼ of the value of the property and "deliver or sell" a land or a building on which said Jews could have built or transfer their synagogue.

In Pompeii, a metropolis of no small renown for its harbor, scrawlings and engravings upon walls do attest to the existence of a Jewish community.\n\nIn the year 1159 Benjamin of Tudela, a renowned traveler, visited the great city and reported the presence of a thriving community of the Jewish faith. Five hundred families called it home, a number surpassed only by the grand community of Salerno, which boasted six hundred families. This community's longevity was a testament to their steadfastness and resilience, for they had maintained their settlement from Antiquity through the centuries of the High Middle Ages.\n\nIn the ancient tomes of lore, evidence of their presence within the great city could be discovered. In the tenth age, they dwelt within a vicus judaeorum, and by the year of our Lord 1097, a grand synagogue hebraeorum had been erected. But it was a most propitious moment in the year 1153 that truly spoke to the prosperity of the Neapolitan community. In the year of grace twelve hundred and thirty-one, the great king Federico of the Swabian folk gathered in the Book of Augustus (the Melfitan Laws) many decrees of old, from the Normans and his own kin, that named the Jews as thralls of his treasury, and freed them from the thraldom of the local lords and the clergy, and showed a friendly mind to all the Jews in his realm of Sicily, for he took them under his kingly shield and gave them equal rights with the Gentiles in matters of justice and strife; and he ordered the craft of money-lending, setting a limit of interest that should not pass ten in the hundred.\n\nBut when the days of Federico the Second and his heirs waned, the mood of the world changed. From the year twelve hundred and eighty-eight, and most of all from twelve hundred and ninety to twelve hundred and ninety-four, a great “storm” broke upon the Jews, wrought by the cunning words of the Black Friars who had honed their speech against them for many years, and which grew yet fiercer with the coming of Charles the Lame after Charles of Anjou."

 FEE_HRE_Minors.1.T:0 "Albrecht Durer"
 FEE_HRE_Minors.1.D:0 "Albrecht Dürer was a painter, printmaker, and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Dürer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. He made his mark in many areas of art, but especially in his woodcuts of religious scenes, landscape paintings, and proportionality in art. He was later commemorated by the Lutheran church, and was seen as one of the foremost artists of the Northern Renaissance."
 FEE_HRE_Minors.1.OPT1:0 "A true Renaissance man."

 FEE_HRE_Minors.2.T:0 "Jewish Presence in the Empire"
 FEE_HRE_Minors.2.D:0 "While Jews were granted limited protection by Emperors during the 14th century, the Hussite Wars and other religious conflicts in the 15th signaled a renewed persecution of Jews throughout the Empire. Medieval attitudes that ascribed all kinds of evils to the Jewish communities intensified in many places in Germany. At the same time, they remain vital contributors to local economies. Additionally, the spread of the Renaissance and humanism has given rise to new attitudes of tolerance."

 FEE_HRE_Minors.3.T:0 "The Diet of Worms"
 FEE_HRE_Minors.3.D:0 "While, initially, the preachings of Martin Luther were seen as just another local heresy to be condemned and uprooted, the explosion of pamphlets, proselytes, and protests have made the Protestant movement too large to ignore. Hoping to head off the controversy, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to convene an unofficial Diet, essentially putting Luther on trial for his beliefs. Despite his delay tactics, Luther eventually was forced to definitively say whether he would recant his beliefs or not. Famously, he responded\nwith “I neither can nor will retract anything; for it cannot be either safe or honest for a Christian to speak against his conscience. Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise; God help me! Amen”"
 FEE_HRE_Minors.3.OPT1:0 "He must be condemned as a heretic."

 FEE_HRE_Minors.4.T:0 "Johannes Gutenberg"
 FEE_HRE_Minors.4.D:0 "A goldsmith, tinkerer, and inventor, Gutenberg made his mark on Western civilization by being the first to introduce the movable type printing press to Europe.

 FEE_HRE_Minors.5.T:0 "The Depression of the 16th Century"
 FEE_HRE_Minors.5.D:0 "As Western Europe begins to bring wealth from the New World and open up maritime trade to the Orient, the traditional wealth of German states dried up and the states of the Empire entered a prolonged depression. The overland routes between Italy and Germany fell into disuse and the trade in north Germany fell further and further behind that of the Atlantic powers. Even the great house of the Fuggers, making loans on the basis of ongoing German prosperity, found themselves overstretched and collapsed into bankruptcy. People began to leave the onceprosperous German cities, many for the booming cities of the Low Countries. "

 FEE_HRE_Minors.6.T:0 "Martin Luther in Hiding"
 FEE_HRE_Minors.6.D:0 "Despite Luther's ringing defense of his faith in the Bible, the Diet of Worms proclaimed him a heretic. A price was laid on his head, giving any Imperial citizen free license to kill Luther. Elector [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, was not about to let this happen. Determined to save the fledgling Reformation while he/she still could, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had him “ambushed” by masked men and spirited away to one of his castles, where no one would find him.\nLuther used the time well, translating the Bible into German directly from the original Greek, writing hymns, and coining the five key tenets of the Reformation, Sola Scriptura, Sola Gratia, Sola Fide, Solus Christus, and Soli Deo Gloria. These five “Sola's” would become the rallying cry of the reformation all over Europe."

 FEE_HRE_Minors.7.T:0 "The Question of the Imperial Navy"
 FEE_HRE_Minors.7.D:0 "The Holy Roman Empire has always been defined by two things; its decentralization and independence of princes, and its focus on internal, mainly German, affairs. As such, the Empire has never had the need or the resources to develop an Imperial Navy.\nHowever, when [Root.GetName] began to invest its own meager resources into a competitive navy, the Emperor did not take long to take note of the development. Now, a diplomat from the Emperor's court has arrived in [Root.GetName] with an interesting proposal.\nPointing out the obvious truth, the Imperial diplomat argued that, since we have invested into expensive warships, our defensive capabilities on land may be sadly lacking in comparison to our neighbors. At the same time, the Emperor has a strong land army but little in the way of a navy. If we were to join forces with the Emperor and place our navy at his disposal should he need it, he would be more than willing to protect us on land in return."

 FEE_HRE_Minors.8.T:0 "Industrialization in the Rhineland"
 FEE_HRE_Minors.8.D:0 "While Britain may have led the way in its abundance of coal, the densely-populated and resource-rich ground of the Rhineland is in an excellent position to compete. And compete we must. Our small size relative to the great European powers means we must find a niche in the emerging international market or become merely a commodity ourselves to be taken, traded, and sold to the highest bidder.

 FEE_Italy_Events.1.T:0 "The Wars of Italy"
 FEE_Italy_Events.1.D:0 "The Italian peninsula of the Middle Ages was divided between the fragmented north, split into numerous fiefs and city-states under the nominal sovereignty of the Holy Roman Emperor, the Kingdoms of Sicily and Naples in the south, and the Papal State that had jurisdiction over parts of central Italy. The fourteenth century was a period of consolidation for the biggest powers of Italy, especially for Milan, Venice, Florence, and the Pope, who expanded their dominions over the smaller cities. The friction that arose from these expansions continued into the next century and culminated with the Lombard Wars between Milan and Venice. Following the signing of the Peace of Lodi in 1454, a balance emerged between the five regional powers; the Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Venice, the Papal State, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Republic of Florence. A mutual defence pact, the Italian League, was formed between them and the four decades that followed were characterized by diplomatic and military balance, overseen by Lorenzo de' Medici. Conflicts were kept small and regionalized, while the Renaissance was flourishing in all Italian centers of culture. This balance was however broken in the last decade of the century, following the death of the Florentine statesman. The spark for the First Italian War was the dynastic succession of the duchy of Milan. \nThe many wars that shaped the Italian peninsula from 1494 on saw the introduction of many significant advances in military technology and tactics, including field artillery, muskets, and combined tactics."

 FEE_Italy_Events.2.D:0 "The infantry saw profound evolutions during the Italian wars, transforming from a predominantly armed force with pikes and halberds to a more flexible arrangement of arquebusiers, pikemen and other specialties. While the first part of the wars saw the prevalence of Swiss mercenaries and lansquenets, groups with firearms established themselves from 16th century. \n\nIn 1503, a skirmish between French and Spanish forces represented the first demonstration of the usefulness of arquebuses in battle. The Spanish general Gonzalo de Codoba feigned a retreat, attracting a contingent of men-at-arms between two groups of his arquebusiers. As the French army found themselves among the shooters, volleys of bullets hit them hard in both flanks. Before the French could attack the vulnerable arquebusiers, a Spanish cavalry charge broke the French forces and forced them to retreat. While the French army was in rout, the Spanish enemies inflicted heavy losses on it. \n\nThe success of the use of firearms in the Italian wars led Niccolò Machiavelli, often described as an enemy of the use of the arquebuses, to write in his treatise On the art of war that all citizens of a city should know how to shoot with a pistol."

 FEE_Italy_Events.4.T:0 "Artillery must be prefectioned"
 FEE_Italy_Events.4.D:0 "The Italian wars saw artillery, especially field artillery, take on an indispensable role in any first-rate army. Charles VIII, during his invasion of Italy, brought with him a truly mobile siege procession, consisting of culverins and bombards mounted on wheeled trolleys, which could be deployed against an enemy fortress immediately upon arrival. The French siege arsenal brought with it several technological innovations. Charles's army used horses to pull cannons rather than the oxen typically used up to that time. Furthermore, French cannons, forged in the same methods used to produce bronze bells, boasted a previously unknown lightness and mobility. The most important improvement of the French however was the creation of iron cannonballs. Before the Italian wars, artillery fired stone balls that often shattered upon impact. The invention of water mills allowed the operation of furnaces with a temperature sufficient to melt the iron in order to make cannon balls. With this technology, Charles's army could conquer, within a few hours, walls and castles that had previously resisted sieges for months or even years. \n\nThe armies of the Italian wars were led by a great variety of commanders, from mercenaries to noble leaders up to the king himself."

 FEE_Italy_Events.5.T:0 "We will be safe behind our Forts"
 FEE_Italy_Events.5.D:0 "Most of the fighting that took place during the Italian wars took place during the sieges. That of the first descent of Charles VIII in Italy is traditionally considered the initial date of the development of the fortification to the modern, which will lead to the birth of increasingly complex fortified systems during the subsequent invasions. The army of Charles VIII in fact had a modern artillery in front of which many antiquated medieval castles had to succumb. These systems will soon spread throughout Europe, initially by Italian engineers."

 FEE_Italy_Events.6.T:0 "Diplomatic Solutions"
 FEE_Italy_Events.6.D:0 "Though the Italian wars raged and most states were caught in the conflict in some capacity, some managed to keep out of the conflict. Though small in size and numbers, the miniscule states and princedoms of the Italian peninsula managed to keep out of the wars and hold their fragile independence intact. This set a precedent in the Italian cities like Monaco and San Marino, where the latter got involved in the Napoleonic Wars. \nNapoleon promised to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic even so far as offering to extend its territory according to its needs. While grateful for the former, the offer of territorial expansion was politely declined by San Marino and the thunders of war was ultimately never brought upon San Marino."

By 1498, the Freedom was all but gone, and Imperial forces would occupy Frisia. \nIt wouldn't take long before this occupation and revocation of ancient freedoms, stemming from the time of Charlemagne himself, would be rejected by the population.

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.5.D:0 "During the Eighty Years' War, or Dutch Revolt, the many Spanish tercios of the Army of Flanders under Julian Romero, employed to purge the anti-Catholic heresy and bring the rebel provinces of Holland and Zeeland back into line were growing restless. They were weary of endless fighting with little to no rest, and frustrated at their lack of pay by the Spanish Crown. The troops had their pay delayed due to Spain's recent declaration of bankruptcy, leading to the bankers refusing to authorise payment until they had negotiated with Phillip II. This meant that the King had to send the physical money by sea, which was much more perilous. To make matters worse, 400,000 florins intended for the soldiers were seized by the English after the ships carrying them were forced to take refuge in English ports during a storm. This pushed the tercios too far. They decided to find their pay for themselves, as was a time old tradition, by sacking a major city. They chose the de facto capital of the Seventeen Provinces at the time, Antwerp, from which to take what they were owed. This was due to the treachery of the Spanish commander of Antwerp Citadel, Sancho d'Avila. He attempted to convince the commander of the garrison of German mercenaries to deliver the city into Spanish hands. This, however, had the opposite effect. The Germans began to improvise defences against the Spaniards and a day before the mutinying tercios arrived, 6,000 Walloon mercenaries were let into the city to help defend it. This was not enough, unfortunately for the city and its citizens. The defences were overrun by the professionally trained soldiers and the Walloon troops not only failed to defend the city, but even fled or participated in the looting of Antwerp. The few remaining Germans and the civilians were massacred, some 7,000 lives lost."

 FEE_Mantua_Events.2.D:0 "Italian architect, writer, mathematician, humanist, cryptographer, linguist, philosopher, musician and archaeologist; he is one of the most multifaceted artistic figures of the Renaissance. Alberti is part of the second generation of humanists (the one following Vergerio, Bruni, Bracciolini, Francesco Barbaro). A constant interest of him was the search for rules, theoretical or practical, capable of guiding the work of artists. In his works he mentioned some canons, for example; in the "De statue" he exposed the proportions of the human body, in the "De pictura" he provided the first definition of the scientific perspective and finally in the "De re aedificatoria", he described all the cases relating modern architecture, emphasizing the importance of the project and the different types of buildings according to their function."

 FEE_Mantua_Events.3.T:0 "Chiesa di San Sebastiano"
 FEE_Mantua_Events.3.D:0 "The first Mantuan intervention concerned the church of San Sebastiano, a private chapel of the Gonzagas, begun in 1460. The building was the foundation for the Renaissance reflections on the Greek cross buildings; it is in fact divided into two floors, one of which is underground apsidal arms around a cubic body with a cross vault; the front arm is preceded by a portico, today with five openings. The upper part of the façade, divided by giant pilasters, is original of the Albertian project and recalls an elaboration of the classical temple, with a broken architrave, tympanum and a Syriac arch, testifying to the extreme freedom with which the architect arranged the elements. Perhaps the inspiration was a late antique work, such as the Orange Arch. The two connecting stairways that allow access to the portico are not part of the original project, but were added later. "

The building was born to replace a shrine where a precious relic of the blood of Christ was venerated. Alberti changed the orientation of the church aligning it with the road axis that connected Palazzo Ducale to the Tea. The church has a Latin cross plan, with a single, large barrel vaulted nave with lacunars, on which side chapels with a rectangular base open up. The choice was also linked to specific ancient references, such as the Etruscan temple described by Vitruvius and the Basilica of Maxentius. In order to monumentally seal the entire area, particular importance was given to the façade, set as a triumphal arch with a single archway between walls, even more monumental than the previous example on the façade of the Malatesta Temple. Greater emphasis is then given by a second upper arch, beyond the tympanum, which marks the height of the nave and which, thanks to the internal opening, allows the lighting of the building. The atrium has a great thickness, as a filtering point between inside and outside, which also recurs in the layout of the internal chapels."

Initially they were directed towards the testimonies of the classical world, and then sculptures, bronzes, coins and medals from the Greek and Roman times. But the Princes, who became patrons, began to commission works from contemporary artists. Inspiration of the Gonzagas were the Wunderkammer of the Princes of Bavaria. In particular, Isabella d'Este looked to this model by creating her own personal study that acquired international notoriety. The Gonzaga collections themselves became an example for the European courts, also for the proverbial intuition shown by the Gonzagas in the choice of the works of their contemporaries. Likewise, art collecting became an instrument of representation and communication in the subtle diplomatic game to which the small Mantuan state necessarily had to apply. The maximum splendor came during the government of the Dukes Vincenzo I Gonzaga and Ferdinando (son of Vincenzo I). By the will of the latter the works of art were inventoried, for the time an inventory prepared with avant-garde criteria, the usefulness of which turned out to be even greater because the diaspora of the works kept in the palaces of Mantua was about to begin.

At the end of the sixteenth century, one of the largest Italian Jewish communities of the time was created in Mantua; over 3,000 people, or 7% of the city's population. At the same time Jewish families carrying out the credit activity moved to the smaller centers governed by the Gonzagas; therefore, small communities with fenerative benches, synagogues and Jewish cemeteries arose in Ostiano (Cremona), Rivarolo Mantovano, Viadana, Pomponesco, Bozzolo, Castel Goffredo."

The king [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Naples had aimed to dissolve the feudal particularism and make the royal power the sole lever of the life of the country. In this context, the clash with the barons inevitably arose around the big problem of an "organic reform of the state", the cornerstones of which were the reduction of baronial power, the development of economic life and the promotion of new entrepreneurs to the ruling class. Neapolitan merchants. An instrument of this policy was the fiscal reform, which entrusted new tasks to the municipal administrations (universities), encouraging them to escape, as far as possible, the feudal weight. And in truth it has been calculated that at that time in the Kingdom of Naples, out of 1550 inhabited centers, only a little more than 100 were assigned to the royal state property, that is, under the direct control of the king and the court, while all the others were controlled by the barons. This meant that the feudal power as a whole was the owner of the resources and finances of the kingdom and that the Aragonese court was in fact made subordinate to the baronial organization. It was therefore natural that the king favored in every way the numerical extension of the state-owned cities, removing them from the feudal weight and incorporating them into his own direct administration. But the undertaking was no small feat. The barons were organized into large, fairly branched dynasties, each of which alone controlled more lands than the king. The Orsini Del Balzo, for example, boasted of being able to travel from Taranto to Naples without ever leaving their possessions; the Sanseverinos, now opposed and now protected by the king, were owners of fiefs which from Calabria, through almost all of Basilicata, reached Salerno and lapped Naples; the Acquaviva, the Caldora, the Caracciolos, the Guevara and the Senerchia completed this small elite in power, which in fact surrounded the capital, suffocating the kingdom."

 FEE_Naples_Events.10.D:0 "A first hard fight between the barons and King Ferrante had already occurred in the long war fought within the kingdom from 1459 to [GetYear]. The king had then obtained the help of many Italian captains, to whom had been added a contingent of 1000 infantry and 700 knights landed from the Adriatic overseas and led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu, the Albanian national hero in search of new lands for the his people dispersed by the Turks. The great losers of that war were Giovanni Antonio Orsini Del Balzo, the last prince of Taranto, who died in Altamura in [GetYear], perhaps suffocated by the king himself through the archpriest of that church, and Antonio Caldora, duke of Bari, who after having been captured in [GetYear] during the siege of Vasto was stripped of all possessions by the sovereign. The fact is that the Orsini del Balzo then lost the vast territory of the Principality of Taranto, which was confiscated by the court, until the Church, after not long, claimed its direct power over Altamura with greater force, thus providing the Del Balzo , feudal lords of the city, an ecclesiastical administration more free from respect for the King and more loyal and faithful to the baron, while the Caldora, after having lost all their territories with that defeat, distributed for the most part in Abruzzo, Molise, in Capitanata and in the land of Bari, they never got up again. In short, the war against the barons of 1459-[GetYear] had ended bitterly, but with a clear victory for the king. He had then been able to resume his policy with greater certainty, innovating in fiscal and feudal legislation, that is, mortifying the baronial prerogatives, extending the power of the court and the state, reorganizing the economic and commercial life of the kingdom. The state-owned cities grew, albeit to an inadequate extent, and the barons underwent the royal initiative for some years. "

 FEE_Naples_Events.14.T:0 "Seconda Congiura dei Baroni"
 FEE_Naples_Events.14.D:0 "The conspiracy was hatched in 1485 by the prince of Salerno Antonello Sanseverino. The latter, advised by Antonello Petrucci, Francesco Coppola and Luigi Gesualdo da Caggiano, gathered around him many feudal families of lords and barons of the kingdom of the Guelph faction in favor of the Angevins, including the Caracciolo, princes of Melfi, the Gesualdo , marquises of Caggiano, the Del Balzo, princes of Altamura and dukes of Andria and Venosa, the Guevara, counts of Apice and Ariano, the Senerchia, counts of Rapone and Sant'Andrea, the aforementioned Caldora and the Sienese barons. The barons who had gathered in Melfi, while sharing the concerns expressed to them by Guevara, did not feel like taking immediate and irrevocable action against Alfonso; they did not believe it was possible at that moment to solicit the intervention of the pope or of the new suitors. Moreover, the memory of the bitter defeat suffered in 1464 still burned. But they did not even want the proposal to fall completely on deaf ears, and they entrusted Girolamo Sanseverino, prince of Bisignano and count of Tricarico and Miglionico, with an exploratory task, to verify at least the possible alliances, seek the consent of the other barons absent from the banquet of Melfi, and possibly attempt the ways of a negotiation with the king. Girolamo Sanseverino, to carry out this exploratory assignment, met in Naples with Petrucci and with Coppola, with the aim of testing the intentions of the court environments and measuring any subsequent steps on them. Obtained from them an interlocutory but not negative answer, a real summit of the Sanseverinos was immediately held in Diano, that is, in the very heart of their feudal possessions, between the Calabria, Basilicata and Salerno. The five most important exponents of this family took part, namely, in addition to Prince Girolamo, Antonello Sanseverino, prince of Salerno, Giovanna Sanseverino, widow of the count of Sanseverino, grandmother of Antonello and aunt of Girolamo, her son Barnaba, count of Lauria, and his other nephew Giovanni, count of Tursi. Meanwhile the Coppola was moving on another side. He had personally gone to King Ferrante to inform him of the growing discontent he had encountered among the barons and declared himself willing to act as an intermediary between them and the court, to watch from within the machination in progress and to turn it in favor of the monarchy. He thus entered with conviction in the mechanism of the conspiracy, also dragging the hesitant royal secretary Antonello Petrucci and his sons into it. In Coppola's intentions, the choice of this ambivalent position should have allowed him to move more easily and with greater personal advantage; on the one hand, in the capacity of the king's envoy, he could have met the barons without making the sovereign suspicious, and on the other he would have deserved the trust of the always suspicious barons, thus mortgaging a prominent place next to them in the event that, once the path of the agreement with the sovereign became impracticable, it was decided to really dethrone the $DYNASTY$ dynasty."

 FEE_Naples_Events.15.T:0 "The Barons have been defeated"
 FEE_Naples_Events.15.D:0 "But things turned out differently and the precautions and intentions of Coppola and Petrucci were completely nullified. King [Root.Monarch.GetName] would have defeated everyone in skill and cynicism. He began by willingly agreeing to Coppola's proposal; he began to treat him since then as a real agent in his service who infiltrated the conspiracy on his behalf. Using it for this purpose, he never ceased to reward him with positions and honors of great prestige. But this did not mean that he entrusted all the destinies of the dynasty to Coppola or renounced his own initiative, which he elaborated and pursued with determination, aided by his son Alfonso. In short, in this intricate affair, Coppola together with Petrucci certainly acted with great ruthlessness, and ended up, together with Petrucci and his two sons, to fall victim to the death trap that he himself had contributed to hatch and to trigger. But it should also be noted that all the characters, including the king, faced the risks of this game by playing it each on more than one table. \nThe plan envisaged by the conspirators was the following; the barons of the territories closest to the capital would have prevented the king from crossing them, thus interrupting the communications of Naples with the rest of the country. Once the capital was isolated, the pope and other reinforcements would be allowed to penetrate the territory of the kingdom on the border between the Papal State and the Abruzzi. In this, the pope would have availed himself of the help of John II of Lorraine, in the name of the old Angevin aspirations for Naples, and of Roberto Sanseverino, the first captain of Italy, who would have acted on behalf of the Republic of Venice, but also for account of his Neapolitan family members. The definitive conclusion of this movement occurred in [GetYear] in the Castel of [Root.Capital.GetName]. In the hall of the barons, the last exponents of the conspiracy against the Aragonese court were arrested and killed. It was [Root.Monarch.GetName] himself who invited the barons into the hall, with the excuse of celebrating the wedding of his niece.

The idea of a Kingdom of Italy that precedes the Risorgimento enterprise by more than four hundred years and to which Ladislao will dedicate all his efforts during his short life. In the years to come, in fact, he would take advantage of the crisis situation in which the composite Italian political reality was pouring to considerably expand his kingdom and his power above all to the detriment of the papal dominions, appropriating and disposing of many of the papal territories as he pleased. \nShould we reclaim the dream of Ladislao and focus on the creation of an Italian state?"

While issuing grand construction projects and modernizing the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government. \nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."

He also commissioned a new palace for the Viceroy, which was then surrounded by buildings in square-grid streets. The Spanish Quarter, as it was called, was the first of its kind in Europe, and is still one of the most distinct areas of Naples. The express goal was to make Naples invulnerable, but it also had the side effect of making it the second largest city in Europe at the time.

 FEE_Ottoman_Events.3.D:0 "Murad II had ruled the Ottoman Empire for more than twenty years, facing insurrection and disloyalty whilecontinuing the Empire's expansion, before retiring in favor of his son Mehmet in late 1444. \nThe transition was unclear however, as the 12-year old Mehmet made famous when calling his father to lead the Turkish armies at the battle of Varna; \"If you are the Sultan, come and lead your armies. If I am the Sultan, I command you to come and lead my armies.\" Murad led the armies and won a great victory over the Christian coalition on November 10th 1444, ending the Crusade of Varna.\n\nMurad was not free to return to retirement, however. While the young Sultan attempted to establish his authority, Çandarli Halil Pasha, grand vizier and true governor of the empire, opposed him. The grand vizier found Mehmed too strongly influenced by his teacher, who Çandarli considered a rival.\nÇandarli arranged for dissent among the janissaries, who threatened with revolt unless Murad were to return to the throne. Still mostly a child, Mehmet acquiesced and Murad returned to once again rule the empire.\nHe passed away five years later, and Mehmet could once again take the throne, this time unopposed. Two days after Mehmet's greatest achievement, the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Sultan had Çandarli put to death."

The diversity of the Devshirme has also served as a unifying factor for our Empire. The various ethnicities of our Empire see that our Sultan is Turkish but his Viziers are Greek, Albanian, Bulgarian. This has prevented a hereditary aristocracy from forming outside of the ruling dynasty. \n \nBut as these various ethnicities gain more and more sway in the dictations in the administration of the Empire as well as the recruitment systems in place, a aristocracy of the Viziers are forming.

The investigative reports from the inquiries, as well as the expensive fees for spies sent, into the Endurun Schools have proved fruitless and seemed to only fuel the rot inside the schools. Same story for the Palace Schools just across the street of the Royal Palace where many of the eunuchs, civil servants and future Viziers are being schooled. 'Where could it all be coming from?' \n \n The Sultan does not need to ask himself for long before the doors to his office quarters are opened.

But in the late 16th century, when the Dutch, British and Iberian traders closed the old international trade routes through the Middle East following the ban, the prosperity and relevance of Ottoman trade has been steadily declining. Plagued by mismanagement, inflation, and Ottoman precious metal export, and the fall of wool prices in favor of cloth, much of the economic activity with the Europeans has led to an increasing trade imbalance. \n \nThe future of the economy, and even of the Empire as a whole lies in its ability to gain its relevance in the international market and decrease the trade imbalance with the Europeans."

More than anywhere else, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has embraced fundamental ideas of religious tolerance and personal freedom. To further these ideals in a time of unrest, King [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proposed a Treaty of Union between Catholic and Orthodox. This Union would effectively outflank Protestantism by the acceptance of Papal authority by the entrenched Orthodox clergy in return for a guarantee of freedom to practice Orthodox rituals.

Ever mindful of profit over faith, those opportunistic snakes have cozied up with the Turks, abandoning all principle for their precious ducats.\n\nThe overland routes to India and the spice trade are all but cut, the lifeline that supplied us with exotic goods and spices. The Venetian monopoly may make them rich, but ultimately we are left spiceless and desperate for it, as is the rest of Europe. This situation is unacceptable!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.D:0 "Nestled in the Southwest corner of Europe sandwiched between Spain and the Atlantic Ocean, the Portuguese people have always been natural seafarers. Lately, however, a prince in our court by the name of Dom Henrique de Viseu has put forth the idea that Portugal must secure a place on the seas in order to sail farther down the coast than any previous Europeans.\nDrawing on Portuguese tactics, cutting-edge Venetian advancements, and newly-discovered science, Henrique has proposed an unprecedented leap in royal patronage of navies. An organized school which not only teaches the sailors and admirals of tomorrow, but researches improved methods of cartography, ship design, and maritime combat. Additionally, he tells us that the royal patronage of the navy to an extent hitherto unseen in Europe will give Portugal the advantage she desperately needs in this age of discovery."

We have already dispatched Alfonso de Albuquerque to re-establish our control. Besides building an island fort in the area, however, he has struggled to find success. None other than Francisco de Almeida has approached us with a new and bold plan to dealing with these annoyances. A local emir has hinted that he might help us, provided we provide him with European gunpowder weaponry with which to do so. Of course, these weapons could later be used against us... \n\n"

Appreciative of Almeida's success, the crown has vested him with the title “Viceroy of India.” Of course, as we yet have little presence in India this title is mostly ceremonial.

Rather than respecting our trade, he demands payment for all the lost trade income he blames on us having better offers than he...\n\nAlmeida wishes to meet this threat head-on at sea rather than wait for the Zamorin to come to us..."

Francisco had sent his only son, Lourenco de Almeida, on routine expeditions of his own to secure additional trade opportunities on the Indian coast. However, news arrived back in Cannanore that Lourenco had run across an Egyptian fleet heading to India to pirate our hard-won trade! \n\nIn the resulting skirmish, Lourenco was killed. Francisco did not take this news well, and went into a deep depression and rage, vowing revenge. His men, having followed him for years through great hardship, are likely to follow him come what may. \n\nMeanwhile back in Lisbon, whispers at the royal court have begun to accuse Almeida of treason against the crown, that he only sought power from himself in India, where distance already makes him de-facto independent. No doubt these whispers are at least partly fueled by jealousy. Indeed, Almeida has been a loyal servant of Portugal since before the way to India was even discovered. However, the risk of treason is real, and it is not to be taken lightly."

No sooner had Alfonso de Albuquerque landed in India as Almeida's replacement than Almeida did the unthinkable. Arresting Alfonso, he gathered a fleet and set sail on his own behalf.

 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.D:0 "Portugal has long had an established, prosperous, and well-tolerated Jewish community within its borders. At times, a full 20% of the population of the Kingdom of Portugal has been Jewish. \n\nWith the final fall of the Moors in Granada came a great expulsion of the Jews throughout the realms of the Catholic Monarchs of Castile and Aragon. Many of them fled to friendly lands such as Holland. However, the presence of a strong Jewish community here has drawn the majority of them to seek asylum in Portugal. \n\nGranting them asylum in his realm might bring [Root.Monarch.GetName] many advantages. Indeed, several of the most prominent families among them have even promised gifts and skilled craftsmen for weaponry to aid [Root.Monarch.GetName] in wars against the Muslims if he lets them in. \n\nAt the same time, tension between Jews and Christians in Portugal is never far from the surface, and an influx of Jewish refugees may spark a crisis."

However, they soon found out that without the centralized bureaucracy and navy from the Malacca Sultans, the importance of the port was greatly diminished. Portuguese merchants now had to compete with a host of smaller ports instead of profiting from Malacca's fabled riches. Action must be taken if we are to received the benefits from the city that our admirals promised us when we set out to take it."

Despite this, however, we were received hospitably, and our hosts' face lit up when we began to describe our weaponry to him! \n\nAfter several days of demonstrating our firearms, including not only their usage but a description of the various parts involved and even how to clean them properly. The local lord of the place, called Satsuma, was most eager to obtain these weapons, and promised well-made swords, silks, and chinaware in exchange for a steady supply of weapons."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.D:0 "An ambitious explorer has arrived at our court seeking an audience, named Ferdinand Magellan. He has already distinguished himself on discovery missions for both the Spanish and Portuguese crowns, including in the now-famous expeditions of Francisco de Almeida. He proposes a new scheme for sailing to the Spice Islands, one where we avoid the tumultuous African and Indian Ocean waters altogether and sail around the southern tip of America instead. Not only would this potentially be a better route to the Spice Islands, he argues, but would also provide the chance to discover yet more new and rich lands beyond the South Atlantic. \n\nRemembering how the Portuguese crown rejected the plans of Christopher Columbus to their everlasting sorrow, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is most reluctant to reject Magellan's plan. However, going under South America also risks violating the Treaty of Tordesillas, angering the Spanish and giving them cause for war."

He wishes first to purify the faith among the Portuguese there, who he finds altogether too focused on wealth and too lax in their faith, and then from there spread the faith to all of our holdings in Asia. Xavier wishes for us to allow him leave to bring yet more Jesuits from Spain into our realm, or else set up our own Inquisition to help him reach his goal. \n\nNaturally, this might bite into our profits, but Xavier and many devout voices insist that this is a worthy sacrifice for the glory of God."

Unfortunately, the capital lies in a dangerous strategic position, for as the riches of Scandinavia and Germany flow into St. Petersburg, so do their dangers. The Gulf of Finland is easily traversable by enemy fleets, and currently any aggressor against us may sail straight into the heart of our capital, into the heart of Russia itself. There is a way to defend the city, however. Kotlin Island stands between the mouth of the Neva and the Gulf proper, meaning all ships coming to harbour at the capital must pass it. Our engineers have proposed a large fortress, to be built on Kotlin Island, which would stand proudly amongst the sea, a great bastion which all enemies must defeat to negotiate safe passage to St. Petersburg!

While in many ways remaining a joint duchy, the elder brother, Ernest, gained the electoral lands around Wittenberg, before dividing the duchy by \"I cut, you choose,\" where Ernest divided the lands. The younger brother, Albert, picked the lands around Meissen, while Ernest gained the recently acquired lands of Thuringia.\nWhile the Wettins remained split in two branches ever since, the Lands of Saxony would be reunited by Maurice of Saxony in 1547, following the Schmalkaldic War. \nNevertheless, decades of separation prevented Saxony from effeciently competing with the dynamic rise of its neighboring rivals, the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg."

(Philippist after Philipp Melanchton, Luther's closest ally.)\nWhile Crypto-Calvinists seized power in the Saxon church during the rule of Elector Augustus, but gradually works that were undeniably Calvinist in nature came to light.

This tradition held so strong, that even Saxon electors who converted to Catholicism were allowed to lead the gatherings, provided the privy council was given charge of all matters religious in Saxony, and only admitted Protestants."

Augustus guaranteed Saxon Protestantism however, and followed orthodox Lutheran doctrine in his dealings with other Protestant states. However, to guarantee future von Wettins for the throne of Poland meant that every possible successor had to convert to Catholicism, including the future elector Augustus III. Upon this the Estates of Saxony began protesting, threatening revolt in defense of the Protestant faith. Augustus II therefore transferred all religious control in Saxony to the Electoral privy council, as suggested by the Corpus Evangelicorum.

She learnt to speak Polish, and was often present for assemblies of the Polish parliament.\nAs a strong political figure, she practically governed Saxony during Frederick Augustus' absence, though she was never officially named regent. She was a dedicated Catholic, even being chided by her confessor for being more religious than behooved a person outside a monastic order. Nevertheless she preached tolerance, and gave alms as much to poor Protestants as poor Catholics.\nAs a former heiress presumtive of the imperial throne, she became an active player in the War of the Austrian Succession, before ceding her claim in favour of an alliance with Austria. Her politicking continued her entire life by influencing the power balance between Saxony and Poland as well as between her sons, the heirs to the thrones. During the Seven Years War, she was placed under house arrest by the Prussians, but kept on communicating with the outside world through the use of Prussian connections and letters written in invisible ink."

It was largely through papal and imperial reaction to the Lutheran texts that they became directives of faith that sparked Luther's reformational work.\n\nNow one of these texts has been discovered before reaching wide circulation, and it does have some deeply incisive comments about papal practices.

As an influential and capable politician, he ensured Calvinsits were appointed to high offices, especially in the church, and he had a translation of the bible with Calvinist annotations published and disseminated.\nIn the end, distrust of his faith and jealousy at his position and influence with the elector meant that when Elector Christian died in 1591, rivals in the nobility ensured that he was arrested. He remained imprisoned for ten years, six of them in trial at the Reichskammergericht, before being sentenced to death for Crypto-Calvinism.\nHe was decapitated in Dresden, and a paving stone with the letters \"Kr\" still marks the exact place of his death."

However, the mere suggestion of “popery” was met with resistance fierce enough to completely catch [SCO.Monarch.GetName] completely off guard. Churches all over Scotland bristled with the changes, and it only took a spark to light them.\n\nThat spark came from Edinburgh itself, the historic heart of the Scottish church. When the new prayer book was first read, one Jenny Geddes, a local young woman, was the first to stand. \"De'il gie you colic, the wame o' ye, fause thief; daur ye say Mass in my lug?\" she yelled. Picking up a humble stool, universally used by congregation members in church's largely barren of seating, Geddes hurled the stool directly at the offending preacher. Within minutes, the entire city was up in arms, and the tumult quickly spread throughout Scotland."

Now, however, fearing the threat of royal absolutism, even more nobles have joined their ranks. Together with notable Presbyterian ministers, representatives from the burghers, and several minor gentry, they have drafted a landmark document, the National Covenant.\n\nThe Covenanters, as they became known, pledged their loyalty both to “the true religion” and to royal authority, but only within limits far below those of European absolutist monarchs. Copies of the Covenant were swiftly carried from Edinburgh throughout all Scotland.\n\nEven more alarming, Scotland's greatest military leaders, including Archibald Campbell, a Highland Chieftain, and Alexander Leslie, a distinguished veteran of the War of the Protestant League on the continent."

After all, who really cares how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?

While not the first to espouse capitalism, Smith would come to be its intellectual champion, framing it in a coherent theory of economics for the first time. His advocacy for a restriction of government control over the economy, while potentially a boon for the Scottish people, runs counter to much of what has traditionally been accepted in the royal court."

Notable authors included Sir Walter Scott, Macpherson (author of the apocryphal Celtic epic \"Ossian\"), and poet Robert \"Robbie\" Burns. Their works helped spark a revival in Scottish national pride and dignity, and the desire to maintain Scotland's unique culture in the midst of great social change.

However, Ferdinando had died, and his successor was uninterested in continuing the colonisation project of his predecessor.

He introduced extensive social, legal and financial reforms in Tuscany, but met extensive opposition from all strata of society, as the reforms were considered too liberal. \nReforming the tax system to ease the burden on citizens, and conducting profitable public works were well received, but his attempts at reducing the power of the clergy was stopped by opposition from the Pope and his political allies. He did achieve many things, however, especially in guaranteeing legal rights for citizens, as well as through legislation and development of hospitals vastly improving the treatment of the mentally ill. This took place through the \"legge sui pazzi,\" the law of the insane, which was the first of its kind in Europe. \nA system for inoculation against smallpox was set up as an early predecessor of vaccination programs, and an early institution for the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents was founded. Peter Leopold also approved and attempted to introduce a constitution in Tuscany, which would see greater rights given to its citizens, and ensure a balance between legislative and executive powers.\n\nThe constitution met fierce resistance, even from those who would benefit from it, and was never put into effect, as Leopold in 1790 moved to Vienna upon his ascension to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire."

 FEE_Venice_Events.1.D:0 "A new phase for the Venetian navy began in 1453, with the fall of Constantinople and the start of the centuries-old confrontation with the Turks. Faced with the growing threat to its maritime possessions, we are faced with the choice of constituting a real permanent naval navy, with dozens of galleys operating in peacetime and an appreciable force of more than one hundred galleys in the event of war."

 FEE_Venice_Events.3.T:0 "Naval Reform"
 FEE_Venice_Events.3.D:0 "At the same time, the spread of firearms gradually led to arming the galleys no longer with traditional Greek fire, but with artillery positioned at the bow and able to fire in the direction of the ship's advance. In the same period, new types of ships were developed. \n The brig, a small and fast ship, similar to a galley, for escort and transport services. About 20 m long and 3 m wide, for about 14 banks. \n The Galeotta, a small ship similar to a galley, but faster and more maneuverable. About 25 m long and 4 m wide, for about 15 banks. \n The Fusta, a small thin galley. About 35 m long and 5 m wide, for about 20 banks. \n The bastard galley, with larger dimensions and fuller stern shapes than the thin galley, capable of acting as a captain or patroness, that is, as a flagship."

The use of this type of ship, however, always remained rather limited in the Venetian navy, so much so that they did not even fall within the normal hierarchy of the fleet and constituted a separate flotilla, dependent on the so-called Governator de 'Condannati."

A new facade was erected for the Volto del Bucintoro, expanding the square to accommodate the ceremonial boat of the same name, rebuilt between 1525 and 1526. Later on, was built, close to the walls overlooking the Rio of San Daniele, the artillery workshop - a building about 180 m long, still existing - and the fifteenth-century arms rooms were renovated. The close collaboration between artillerymen, smelters and manufacturers of powders, inside and outside the arsenal, contributed to the affirmation of the Venetian war industry, at the forefront in Europe for almost two centuries, with the invention of lethal weapons such as shooting mortars curved, huge siege bombards, culverins, falcons and battle falconets. A decree of the Commission of Ten and the Superintendent of Artillery of 1565 explicitly refers to the presence of "artillery factories" distributed in various warehouses in the arsenal."

In 1569 there was a powerful explosion of dust in the Celestia area, causing extensive damage to the walls, some building sites and the Celestia convent. A fifth extension dates back to the same period, with the excavation of the dock of the Galeazze, covering yards for the construction of this new type of battleship, which proved to be decisive for obtaining victory during the numerous naval battle.\n The construction of the small temple of the Madonna of the Arsenale leaning against the eastern tower of the Arsenale water gate; later on the architect Antonio da Ponte rebuilt the building of the Corderie; the monumental access portal to the arms rooms and to the artillery workshop that closes the Stradal de Campagna was built."

The inhabitants were then evicted to allow Jews to be imprisoned in a Ghetto. The only two entrances to the island, the bridges over the Rio di San Girolamo and the Rio del Ghetto, were closed at night and were guarded by Christian guardians, paid by the Jews themselves. \n The first inhabitants of the Ghetto Nuovo were the Jews of the Tokesca nation (Ashkenazi), which had the obligation to manage pawn shops.

Foscari, however, had managed to save himself by fleeing to Trieste. Two days later the Ten banished him from Venice in perpetuity, condemning him to exile in Nauplia. The super-command Marco Trevisan was then sent to Trieste to execute the sentence and on 3 March the Dogaressa was forbidden to travel to Julian city to visit her son. In fact, according to historical documents, it seems that the Council had acted with a certain mildness perhaps due to pressure from the doge and his family. The Trevisan left for Trieste no earlier than 25 February and in any case did not succeed in capturing the Foscari since on 11 March the doge was asked to induce his son to turn himself in. In the following months, the Dieci was substantially inert and only on 28 November 1446 was the confinement at Nauplia converted with that at Zelarino, a Venetian locality very close to the Lagoon of which the Foscari were feudal lords. Finally, on 13 September 1447, the Dieci granted a pardon. \n\nA today the Ten came back to deal with him, he was now accused of entertaining correspondence with Francesco Sforza and even Muhammad II. On 12 June, therefore, the super-committee Lorenzo Loredan was sent to Chania. He brought Foscari back to Venice where, on 24 July, the Council gave him the mildest sentence, i.e. confirmation of his Cretan exile.

Francesco Foscari was buried in the presbytery of the basilica of the Frari, in the mausoleum made for him by Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino, in an urn supported by four graceful corbels adorned with the three theological virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity) in whose arrangement around the sarcophagus Niccolò modified the conventional and static arrangement of the personifications, transforming it into a drama inserted in the flow of time.

The infantry regiments were then extremely small, certainly manageable (useful dowry in mountainous environments or amphibious warfare), but impractical for battles on the plains, especially against the gigantic Austro-Hungarian regiments (about 2,200-2,800 men fully staffed) or with the French half brigades, equally very mobile because they are based on multifunctional battalions (with line infantry, hunters and grenadiers and capable of fighting both in skirmishes, in line, and an assault column)."
