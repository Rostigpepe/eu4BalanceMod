 FEE_Austria_Events.1.T: "The Reforms of the 1495 Diet of Worms"
 FEE_Austria_Events.1.D: "The reforms presented at the Diet of Worms in 1495 was the Emperor Maximilian I's attempt at centralising the Holy Roman Empire. The most lasting of these reforms was the establishment of the Reichskammergericht, which would function as the Empire's highest court, along with an imperial ban on internal feuding, the Ewiger Landfriede.\n\nMaximilian also established an Imperial government, the \"The Reichsregiment,\" which was separate from the emperor's court. This was intended to efficiently administrate the Empire as a whole, even outside of the Imperial Diet. It would represent every princedom in the Empire, but never fully managed to assume its position of power, and was dissolved in 1502."
 FEE_Austria_Events.1.OPT1: "We will force through the centralisation of the Empire!"
 FEE_Austria_Events.1.OPT2: "The princedoms are pleased with the status quo."

 FEE_Austria_Events.2.T: "The Rise of the Ottomans in Europe"
 FEE_Austria_Events.2.D: "With their recent gains, there can no longer be any doubt. The Ottomans conquer everything in their way, and will stop at nothing until they have subjugated all of Christendom in the name of their heathen god. We are the bastion standing against them for the sake of Europe and of God. This is the time to reaffirm that our borders will hold strong."
 FEE_Austria_Events.2.OPT1: "For God!"
 FEE_Austria_Events.2.OPT2: "We have other worries, let's pursue a diplomatic path."

 FEE_Austria_Events.3.T: "The Austrian Baroque"
 FEE_Austria_Events.3.D: "While devastated by the long wars of the early 17th century, the Imperial Austria proved resilient, and the peace that followed became a time of great artistic patronage.\nWhether painting, sculpture or architecture, the Habsburgs were among the foremost patrons in the world. Over the course of a century, the already grand imperial capital of Vienna was expanded and developed, resulting in the largest baroque palaces in the world towering over peasants and kings alike. While the emperor's strict yoke went against the political development of the era, Austrian art flourished."
 FEE_Austria_Events.3.OPT1: "Austria will be the grandest country of the Baroque!"
 FEE_Austria_Events.3.OPT2: "Let's consider reorganising society instead."

 FEE_Austria_Events.4.T: "Austria into the Future"
 FEE_Austria_Events.4.D: "As people and - more importantly - artists start to think that baroque art is beginning to be a bit much, the Austrian administration can only agree. While the Baroque has left a strong mark on the artistry of our empire, new and somewhat subtler artistic principles are forming in its wake. As we have embraced the beauty of baroque art, so we shall embrace these new ideas."
 FEE_Austria_Events.4.OPT1: "Our greatness is far from at an end!"

 FEE_Austria_Events.5.T: "Build Beautiful Palaces"
 FEE_Austria_Events.5.D: "With the current craze for Baroque buildings, it has come to our attention that some of our current construction projects could be made even greater, more impressive and more beautiful. This would take a relatively small investment considering the grandeur and wealth it will display, and considering our position as one of the most prestigious states in the world, we cannot afford to not show off.\nYou cannot put a price on true art, so let's make the right choice, for the glory of Austria."
 FEE_Austria_Events.5.OPT1: "Make it even more baroque!"
 FEE_Austria_Events.5.OPT2: "Something simple will do."

 FEE_Austria_Events.7.OPT2: "Something simple will do."

 FEE_Austria_Events.8.T: "Philip the Good requests the Lotharingian crown"
 FEE_Austria_Events.8.D: "After the death of Louis the Pious in 840 the Carolingian Empire was divided between his three sons. Two of these Kingdoms would survive to become France and the Holy Roman Empire. The third Kingdom, Lotharingia, dwindled and was upon the death of King Zwentibold absorbed into Germany. Twice during his reign Philip the Good requested from Emperor Frederick III the vacant title and crown of Lotharingia."
 FEE_Austria_Events.8.OPT1: "Deny him the crown."
 FEE_Austria_Events.8.OPT2: "Grant him the crown."

 FEE_Austria_Events.9.T: "Vienna captured by Matthias Corvinus"
 FEE_Austria_Events.9.D: "Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, was the nemesis of Emperor Friedrich V. They both claimed the Hungarian and Bohemian throne, they mistrusted each other, they both were eager to dominate southeastern Europe - thus saw each other as their greatest obstacle - and they were contrary characters, Friedrich patient, contemplative, fatalistic and sometimes phlegmatic, Matthias determined, ambitious and aggressive. Thus the peace concluded between Poland, Bohemia and Hungary in 1477 did not include Friedrich. The rivalry between the two, before sparked by Friedrich suspecting Matthias of secretly allowing the Ottomans to invade Austria through Hungary and supporting Wladislas Jagiello as King of Bohemia against the claims of Matthias, deteriorated into a personal feud. On the battlefield, Matthias Corvinus got the upper hand, swiftly defeated Friedrich even after he had gathered an Imperial army and invaded his hereditary lands. Within 5 years, Matthias' army reduced Frederick's strongholds one by one. The Emperor was deeply humiliated and his defeat evident in 1485 when Hungarian armies captured Vienna and he had to flee to Linz. In the last years of his life he was deeply depressive due to this shame. Vienna was only recaptured by his son Maximilian."
 FEE_Austria_Events.9.OPT1: "Curses!"

 FEE_Austria_Events.10.T: "Corvinus' offer"
 FEE_Austria_Events.10.D: "Having been offered the throne by some malcontent nobles, in 1459 Friedrich III was crowned King of Hungary with the crown of St. Stephen that had been in his possession since 1440. When Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, had managed to crush the rebellious nobles and secure his diplomatic positions by reaching agreements with Jiri Podiebrad of Bohemia and the mercenary Jan Vitovec who had seized the former Cilli estates and he was about to threaten Austria, Friedrich quickly accepted a treaty in which we abandonned his claim on Hungary, but kept the title of King of Hungary, retained several border districts including the towns of Guns and Eisenstadt, was ceded the city of Sopron, received a ransom of 60000 ducats for the crown of St. Stephen and was appointed heir of Matthias in case of a childless death."
 FEE_Austria_Events.10.OPT1: "Accept the offer"
 FEE_Austria_Events.10.OPT2: "Press the claim on Hungary"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.3.T: "Death of Jiri Podebrad"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.3.D: "Jiri Podebrad died in 1471, in the middle of his struggle with Mathias Corvinus of Hungary whonheaded a 'crusade' against Bohemia and claimed its throne. Since his supporters were in a precarious military situation, having lost all lands of the Bohemian Crown to the King of Hungary, Podebrad had shortly before his death, despite being the father of several adult sons himself, asked prince Vladislav of Poland to succeed him in order to save Hussitism and Bohemian independence, already experienced in war over in his days in Poland.. Vladislav indeed succeeded him and initiated a half-century of Jagiellon rule in Bohemia which proved to be backwards, intolerant in religious matters, devastating for Bohemia's economy and eventually resulted in the disaster of 1526. However had Podebrad been in a better situation, he might very well have used the opportunity to establish his dynasty as hereditary national Kings of Bohemia."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.3.OPT1: "Elect Vladislav Jagiello!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.3.OPT2: "Elect, Son of Jiri; Duke Victor"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.4.T: "The Bohemian Throne"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.4.D: "Jiri Podebrad died in 1471, in the middle of his struggle with Mathias Corvinus of Hungary who headed a 'crusade' against Bohemia and claimed its throne. Since his supporters were in a precarious military situation, having lost all lands of the Bohemian Crown to the King of Hungary, Podebrad had shortly before his death, despite being a father of several adult sons himself, asked prince Vladislav of Poland to succeed him in order to save Hussitism and Bohemian independence. Vladislav indeed succeeded him and initiated a half-century of Jagiellon rule in Bohemia."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.4.OPT1: "Accept the Bohemian Offer!"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.T: "Death of Matthias Corvinus"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.D: "In the last years of his reign, Matthias Corvinus tried to ensure the succession of his highly gifted, but illegitimate son Janos, made him the largest landholder in Hungary after the King by several grants of territory, put him in charge of several of the strongest and most important fortresses, gave him the holy crown of St. Stephen and got a majority of the royal council to support Janos. However Matthias Corvinus died of a stroke before the matter was definitely secured, and the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Matthias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471. Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490 and immediately thereafter accepted the compact of Farkashida in which he confirmed all existing privileges of the nobility and took back all legal and administrative reforms, including the efficient system of taxation regarded as repressive by the magnates. After 3 decades of prosperity and modernisation, the election of Vladislav initiated a rapid decline, ending up in the disaster of Mohacs. Another candidate to the throne was Maximilian of Habsburg who maintained the claim of his father Friedrich III, but since he had already proven to be a capable ruler and would have been likely to use his powerbase in the Empire, Austria and Burgundy to consolidate his authority in Hungary, he was no popular choice. Had Janos Corvinus indeed managed to become King, he might have continued the achievements of his father but would have been violently opposed by the powerful magnates."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.OPT1: "Elect Vladislav Jagiello!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.OPT2: "Janos Corvinus shall be King!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.OPT3: "Elect a Habsburg"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.6.T: "Wladyslaw Jagiello, King of Hungary"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.6.D: "Matthias Corvinus of Hungary died in 1490. It had been his explicit wish to let his illegitimate son Janos succeed him, however, when Corvinus was dead, the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Matthias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471. Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490. Like Bohemia, Hungary came thus under Polish domination. "
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.6.OPT1: "Great!"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.7.T: "Civil War in Hungary"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.7.D: "After Matthias Corvinus of Hungary's sudden death, a bitter conflict over his succession has arisen. Following his explicit wish, his illegitimate son Janos has been crowned King, however, there is considerable resistance among the magnates who are fed up with strong royal authority and high taxes. They have decided to revolt against the new King in order to protect their interest. Meanwhile, Friedrich III still bears the title King of Hungary and he and his son Maximilian are regarded by some Hungarians as the legitimate successor to the throne. Taking advantage of the conflict within it, it might be easy to press the claim and conquer Hungary now."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.7.OPT1: "Claim the Hungarian Throne!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.7.OPT2: "We have imperial issues."

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.8.T: "The Kingdom of Hungary"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.8.D: "The Kingdom of Hungary has elected a new monarch, [HUN.Monarch.GetName], who lacks the support of a huge part of the nobility. There can be expected to be a long internal struggle, a pit of chaos which would probably give the Sultan an excellent opportunity to expand north."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.8.OPT1: "Chaos is not a pit, Chaos is a ladder."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.9.T: "Lessons of the Hussite Wars"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.9.D: "What was once the jewel of Central Europe was mercilessly torn apart as brother fought against brother, foreigners invaded Bohemian lands, and bitter religious struggle the like of which has never before been seen within Christian Europe came to our kingdom.\n\nHowever, there was some benefit to the extreme violence which engulfed our nation. Many of the most talented and educated Bohemians flocked to the Hussite cause, and their ingenuity allowed them to craft new weapons and fight against overwhelming odds.\n\nIn fact, many of the new weapons and tactics used would later grow to define early modern European warfare. The infamous Hussite wagon fort would be adopted by German, Hungarian, Russian, and even British armies. The Hussite armies also pioneered artillery pieces such as the howitzer and the houfnice, as well as new and more deadly hand cannons which served as thebasis for early modern pistols."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.9.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.10.T: "A Message of Peace"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.10.D: "Despite being condemned as a heretic by the Pope after a forcible seizure of power, Jiri Podebrad never ceased to reconcile with not only the Pope, but the hostile neighboring Catholicrulers of Austria, Hungary, and Poland.\n\nPerhaps ahead of his time, Podebrad proposed a 'Charter of a Universal Peace Union,' in which all Christian nations, starting with the member states of the Holy Roman Empire, would pledge to resolve all disputes peacefully, respect one anothers' national sovereignty, and create a common parliament and court, in which all members would get one vote, with the King of France having two. Additionally, he dreamed of uniting Christian nations against the rising threat of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOne proponent of Podebrad's plan was a prominent nobleman who proved himself an able diplomat, representing Bohemia in the courts of Austria and Hungary. His work, while unsuccessful in establishing Podebrad's dream, did go a long way towards smoothing over the rift between Bohemia and her neighbors. \n\nPodebrad's Hussite beliefs prevented his ideas from being seriously considered, especially as the Pope, whose power was threatened by this Union, worked against him. However, his message of peace planted a seed in European politics that would never be wholly forgotten."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.10.OPT1: "Unfortunate, but we can make some good out of this."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.10.OPT2: "How naïve! Perhaps we should forget the whole thing."

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.11.T: "Thaler Coinage"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.11.D: "Shortly after a rich deposit of silver was found in Joachimsthal, the Crown of Bohemia gave control of the mines to the wealthiest noble family in Bohemia, the Counts von Schlick. They began minting a new large silver coin, giving the name of the town to the new coin - the Thaler. This would go on to become the first truly standardized coinage across the Holy Roman Empire, and would become the ancestor of the British silver crown, the Dutch rijksdaalder, and even the US dollar.\n\nThis large, reliable coin filled the void as a reliable standard of exchange between the regions of Europe, especially in the prosperous but divided principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, where the coin received Imperial approval."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.11.OPT1: "Wonderful news!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.11.OPT2: "Yes yes, very nice, but what's in it for me?"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.12.T: "The Defenestration of Prague"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.12.D: "If recent history has taught us one thing, it is that the Bohemian people are not to be trifled with in matters of religion and maintaining of their treasured religious unity.\n\nThis lesson seems to have been lost on those who would be our overlords. A delegation has arrived in Prague, demanding that we tear up our Letter of Majesty which guarantees religious tolerance and enforce Catholicism on our populace."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.12.OPT1: "Throw them out the window!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.12.OPT2: "We have no choice but to submit."

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.13.T: "Sack of Prague"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.13.D: "Disaster has befallen us! Prague, once one of the great cultural and economic centers, has fallen to the invading enemy! We can only curse the foolishness of our rulers who, scorning the example of past rulers, sought peace with enemies on the field rather than through a siege of their capital city. A full quarter of the city has been levelled and even the great cathedral has suffered damage."

 FEE_Brandenburg_Events.58.D: "As part of the religious peace in the empire, much of the lands once loyal to the Order of St John were secularized and annexed by their de-jure overlords, this greatly reduced the Electors reach, and benefitted the protestant nations of the empire, as many now found themselves with a new source of levies and taxes."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.1.T: "Francis Bacon"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.1.D: "Educated first as a lawyer and then as a statesman, Sir Francis Bacon quickly rose to prominence due to a brilliant intellect and a passionate devotion for understanding and uncovering the truth in all areas.\n\nHis greatest work, the Novum Organum, was a breakthrough in the scientific understanding of the world, where Bacon laid a foundation for empiricism and outline for the first time the steps of the Scientific Method."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.1.OPT1: "An excellent minister!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.T: "The Authorized Version"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.D: "As the Reformation and printing press sweep mainland Europe in tandem, here in England the Bible has been no stranger to the English tongue. Indeed, as far back as 1382 the Bible was translated into English by John Wycliffe. In more recent times, translations from the continent have started to arrive, and the first printed English Bible was produced by William Tyndale in 1525.\n\nHowever, the Wycliffe Bible is outdated and thus difficult to read; the continental translations are too full of notes (some of which run contrary to our own beliefs!) to be useful, and Tyndale's Bible is incomplete.\n\nTo this end, $MONARCH$ has summoned a conference at a royal palace in Hampton Court, including scholars, theologians from every protestant sect in England, and even playwrights and printers. Of this motley crew, who shall be primarily entrusted with the Word of God?"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.OPT1: "Only the theologians can be trusted in this matter."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.OPT2: "Surely the eminent scholars of our land are best suited for this task."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.OPT3: "Would not God himself wish his Word be translated with beauty?"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.2.OPT4: "On second thought, perhaps ths whole thing isn't worth it."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.3.T: "The Wicked Bible"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.3.D: "The royal project to translate the Bible into English was an astounding success. Not only is it a uniform translation, but one done with such literary excellence that many scholars consider it stylistically superior to the Greek original!\n\nWhile the finished product may be magnificent, that did not, however, prevent several errors on the part of the printers. One particularly embarrassing error, quickly dubbed the Wicked Bible to riotous laughter among the populace, omitted the word “not” from one of the Ten Commandments. The result? “Thou shalt commit adultery.” Of course this defect was quickly corrected, but what shall be done with such a miscreant printer?"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.3.OPT1: "Fine him, revoke his license, and confiscate his business!"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.3.OPT2: "This was embarrassing, but still a simple mistake."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.4.T: "The Acts of Union"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.4.D: "With the subjugation of Scotland all but completed and with the reigning in of Ireland well underway, the Acts of Union seek to formalize this unification de jure by claiming the mantle of the ancient Roman name of Britannia. However, while England is by far the largest and most powerful of the three British crowns of England, Scotland, and Ireland, a lasting union cannot be maintained simply with England alone while ignoring the others. As the Romans did before us, the Celtic fringe of Britannia is simply too proud and tumultuous to be ignored, and perhaps unable to be controlled by military means alone.\n\nTo the end of preserving a stable union, the Acts of Union have been proposed, creating a co-equal union rather than a purely English-dominated empire, in which Scottish and Irish concerns would both be heard. Doing this would keep the individuals kingdom's commotions from destabilizing the land as a whole."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.4.OPT1: "We must have a complete and co-equal union!"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.4.OPT2: "The Scots must be included, but the Irish will always be our subjects."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.4.OPT3: "England has always dominated these Isles and can do so alone!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.5.T: "The Statutes of Icolmkill"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.5.D: "Despite the de jure unification of the crowns of Britain, several more rambunctious elements, especially the Highland clans, still manage their own affairs with little regard for what the crown has to say. Our Scottish officials have managed to bring them willy-nilly to the table to settle their differences with us at Icolmkill but perhaps continuing this decentralized pattern would be beneficial for us in the long term?"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.5.OPT1: "Ours shall be an Indirect Empire."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.5.OPT2: "Bah! We can rule every one of these louts ourselves!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.6.T: "Samuel Pepys"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.6.D: "Despite having no maritime experience, Samuel Pepys was a skillful navigator in the political sense, using his position as a member of Parliament to secure a place in the Admiralty. There, he proved surprisingly adept at his various duties, overseeing an early professionalization of navies in Britain. Additionally, the careful diaries he kept would not only prove a useful historical source but also provide a role model for British captains in their record-keeping."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.6.OPT1: "An excellent minister!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.7.T: "The Puritans"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.7.D: "Despite the relative religious peace enjoyed by our island, in marked contrast to the religious strife on the continent, not everyone here is satisfied with our religious state of affairs. A number of more radical sects have found a receptive audience.\n\nThe most prominent of these are a sect of radical reformers who have come to be called Puritans due to their belief that our church is impure and must be radically purged and purified to be acceptable to God. Their biggest grievances with us include our toleration of Catholics and other heretics, as well as what they view as materialism and hedonism within the church.\n\nTheir influence is magnified by the fact that many of their followers come from within the emerging middle and merchant classes."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.7.OPT1: "I suppose they have some valid points. Allow them to speak freely."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.7.OPT2: "What a bunch of complainers! Enforce religious uniformity and silence them."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.7.OPT3: "Let them build their Utopia - somewhere else."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.8.T: "The South Sea Company"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.8.D: "With wars and unrest always taxing on the national economy, a few ambitious and pragmatic bankers have approached us with a way out our current financial straits. Not only would this rid us of our national debt, they say, but would also stand to make not only us, but anyone who invests in their plan a healthy profit.\n\nTheir plan? Turn our debt into payable securities to be sold in exchange for stock in their new trading company, dubbed the South Seas Company, which would receive a crown monopoly on all trade in the “South Seas.” What exactly the South Seas are was never really defined anywhere, but the agents of the Company assure us that our share of Company stock would make us more money than we could dream of needing to pay off our debt.\n\nIt all seems rather confusing, and nothing has been specified or promised on paper. Our bankers strongly advise against this, but it could yet solve our problems."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.8.OPT1: "By all means, do... whatever it is they said we should do, and hope it pays off!"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.8.OPT2: "This seems too good to be true."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.9.T: "South Sea Bubble Bursts"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.9.D: "We should have known it was too good to be true!\n\nWith their wild promises, royal backing, but no real assets to secure their scheme, people from the richest circles to the poorest alleys flocked to put everything they had into the South Sea Company. The soaring stock prices caused a ripple effect causing rents, food, and even human hair to become astronomically expensive as everyone anticipated a quick and easy payout. That is, until some of the most prominent shareholders realized what was going on and pulled out. The resulting crash wiped out the fortunes of thousands overnight and high prices for everything that few could afford. Many have even been driven to suicide.\n\nThese scheming scoundrels have single-handedly crashed the national economy!"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.9.OPT1: "Someone must pay!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.10.T: "South Sea Company Pays Off"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.10.D: "They sounded suspicious, but somehow they pulled it off! Perhaps it's best not to ask how they did it or where the money actually came from, but either way it has gone a long way towards stabilizing our economy."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.10.OPT1: "Great!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.11.T: "Jenkins' Ear"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.11.D: "Relations have never been good between the [fee_eng_gbr_iberian_rival_country.GetAdjective] and ourselves in our competition for New World and African trade. Now, however, has come yet another increase in tensions due to the barbarous conduct of the [fee_eng_gbr_iberian_rival_country.GetAdjective]!\n\nIt seems that a ship of the [fee_eng_gbr_iberian_rival_country.GetAdjective] coast guard - a fine title for a glorified pirate! - stopped and boarded a British merchant vessel. Robert Jenkins, the ship's master mariner, was accused of smuggling. Without trial or hesitation, the [fee_eng_gbr_iberian_rival_country.GetAdjective] captain simply drew his sword and cut off Jenkins' Ear! Worse, he threatened to do the same to our monarch if he should come.\n\nThis gravest indignity weighs not only on Jenkins but on the honor of our entire nation!"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.11.OPT1: "This is cause for war!"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.11.OPT2: "This is not important enough for war."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.12.T: "George Frederic Handel"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.12.D: "While originally from Prussia, George Frederic Handel was a Baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London. Often considered one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era, and indeed of Western Civilization generally, Handel was known for his choral compositions, sinfonias including “Arrival of the Queen of Sheba,” and coronation anthems for the British crown.\n\nHis greatest achievement, “The Messiah,” was an opera showcasing the Christmas and Easter stories, whose chorus so impressed $MONARCH$ that it caused [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to rise from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] seat in respect, an honor that no British monarch had ever given a composer."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.12.OPT1: "Hallelujah!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.13.T: "Statute of Icolmkill"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.15.D: "Francis Drake was a renowned English Explorer, famous for his naval exploits, discovery of what we have now called New Albion and his Circumnavigation of the world from 1577 to 1580. Beloved by our people and our [Root.Monarch.GetName], he has just been awarded a knighthood and made Mayor of Plymouth. Fortunately for us, he has no intentions of ending his days quietly, having approached the [Root.Monarch.GetName] asking for a purpose once again. What shall we do with the man?"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.15.OPT1: "Let us make Sir Drake our greatest privateer!"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.15.OPT2: "He shall go forth and seek out the wonders of the world for us!"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.15.OPT3: "Let him oversee all our young colonial captains!"

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.16.T: "The Great Plague of London"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.16.D: "We have been punished by God. A grave illness has befallen the capital, turning the city into a dire Necropolis, a place of plague and dying men. The crown of England has already faded, trade, tax and production dying out, tarnished and dirty. To think that God, who we were so faithful to, has struck down so many innocents simply staggers the mind. The recent epidemic is thought to have come from diseased cotton brought by the Dutch, Amsterdam having been ravaged by the plague but a year before. What is clear fact is hazy and clouded from that point onward, all the chroniclers claimed by the sickness. $MONARCH$ abandoned his capital in its hour of need, cowardly leaving his/her subjects, his/her countrymen, to suffer and writhe; all the while the craven fool flees with his/her opulence and wealth to greener pastures! London, and through its influence the world, shall suffer greatly from these events. 'But, Lord! how sad a sight it is to see the streets empty of people, and very few upon the 'Change. Jealous of every door that one sees shut up, lest it should be the plague; and about us two shops in three, if not more, generally shut up.' — Diary of Samuel Pepys, Wednesday, 16 August 1665."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.17.D: "London is ablaze, consumed in hellfire! The opulent capital of our great nation razed by forces beyond our control once more, first sickened by plague and now gutted by fire. A terrible vengeance swept through the old city, engulfing the old walls of the Square Mile, destroying all in its path. London will never be the same again. The citizens lay dead, the buildings destroyed, corpses strewn in the street, pain and suffering thick and rife in the air. Let this event be remembered as the greatest tragedy ever to befall our city. 'They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded me to go to my Lord Mayor from him and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way.'- Samuel Pepys"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.17.OPT1: "Let this day stand in the history books for all time."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.18.T: "The Great Fire of London"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.18.D: "London has been destroyed, but all is not lost. Opportunity can be found in any catastrophe and this is no different.

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.19.T: "The Field of the Cloth of Gold"
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.19.D: "The ambitions of the Holy Roman Emperor in Europe have gone unchecked for too long. In June of 1520, the two kings of England and France, Henry VIII and Francis I, met at Balinghem in the Pas-de-Calais to discuss how to deal with the rapidly growing threat of Charles V, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor. By this time the centuries-old rivalry between England and France was dying down, and both kings wished to be seen as renaissance princes, delivering peace through their own strength. The summit was termed the 'Field of the Cloth of Gold' for its opulence and grandiose nature, each king striving to outdo the other in wealth, with dazzling tents and clothes, huge feasts, music, jousting and games. The tents and the costumes displayed so much cloth of gold, an expensive fabric woven with silk and gold thread, that the site of the meeting was named after it."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.19.OPT1: "Let us extend an offer to the French of a summit."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.20.D: "In 1543, the king of Scotland had died, leaving the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. In the same year, England and Scotland agreed in the Treaty of Greenwich that Prince Edward of England should marry the young Scottish queen. However, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament. \nHenry VIII of England still desired to see the two countries united, and used the rejection of the treaty as an excuse to renew the war against Scotland, with the goal of forcing Queen Mary to wed his son. \nThe resulting conflict lasted for eight years of terrible warfare, but saw Scotland retain its independence."
 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.20.OPT1: "It is in our interest to unite the crowns."

 FEE_England_Great_Britain_Events.21.T: "Sake Dean Mahomed"

His father worked for the East India Company, and upon his death, the ten year old Sake was adopted by a British Captain. He became a surgeon in the British Army, and fought in the war against the Marathas. When his foster father and closest friend resigned from the army, Mahomed accompanied him to Britain. \n\nThere he published his book, \"The Travels of Dean Mahomet\", which described several Indian cities, as well as the faded glories of the Mughal Empire. He went on to open Britain's first Indian restaurant, as well as introducing Indian soaps and the practice of \"shampoo\". This was how he went on to become the \"shampooing surgeon\" for both King George IV and William IV."

His father worked for the East India Company, and upon his death, the ten year old Sake was adopted by a British Captain.

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.1.T: "Dawn of the Age of Enlightenment"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.1.D: "Following conflict and bloodshed, as well as the development of new scientific and ideological practices, the authority of religion has been shaken, and the truth of the world no longer seems as simple as it once did. Humans know more now than we ever have before, and yet the only thing we are certain of is that there are so many answers yet to find. \nNevertheless, every year sees new discoveries and ideas, and philosophers are no longer just developing traditions, but ideas and worldviews.\n\nWith these developments happening in our country as well as across Europe, we have entered the Age of Enlightenment."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.1.OPT1: "These are the times we live in."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.2.T: "Coffee House Gathering"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.2.D: "A group of philosophers, scientists and \"thinkers\" have started regularly meeting in one of our capital's newly opened coffee houses. In addition to greatly benefiting local café business, their free exchange of thoughts brings new ideas to the fore, and occasionally acts as the source of a new breakthrough that people in the know assures us is ery exciting."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.2.OPT1: "Make sure they discuss the challenges facing $COUNTRY$."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.2.OPT2: "It does little harm to let them babble freely."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.3.T: "Enlightened Absolutism"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.3.D: "While many enlightenment thinkers are critical of monarchies, and many monarchs are suspicious of enlightened ideals, there are those who realise the enlightened path is the way of the future. Ideas developed by modern philosophers can aid our bureaucracy and lend even greater legitimacy to our absolute rule. On the other hand, some of them speak of terrifying things like self-determination and pluralistic governments."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.3.OPT1: "$MONARCH$ is a modern monarch, embracing the enlightened ideals!"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.3.OPT2: "These ideas are ridiculous, and should not be legitimised."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.T: "Supporting the Scientific Revolution"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.D: "In our modern day and age, the methods of the natural scientists of antiquity are coming up short. No longer is thinking and imagining the universe enough to discover the truth. Instead, self-styled \"scientists\" have begun developing strict methodologies to ensure that the theories they posit can be tested and developed. \nIt is undeniable that this has led to some incredible advances, but although they CLAIM to be thoroughly tested, the fact is that many \"scientific\" discoveries seem to go against clerical teaching."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.OPT1: "Knowing the truth means holding the advantage. We will support them, for $COUNTRY$!"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.4.OPT2: "The truth has already been written out for us. It's right there in the bible!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.5.T: "Discoveries of the Scientific Revolution"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.5.D: "Following the development of new scientific practices, and greater emphasis on certainty even over sensibility, great new discoveries about our world seems to be made every other day. The human body, physics and even mathematics does not always work the way one would think, and our support for academic institutions and prolific scientists has helped greatly."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.5.OPT1: "It is time for the practical implementation of this knowledge."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.5.OPT2: "Continue striving for ever greater discoveries."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.6.T: "$COUNTRY$ Suffers From Lack of Scientific Innovation"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.6.D: "With many other countries in Europe actively supporting new developments in the eternal search for human knowledge, our insistence on adherence to the time-tested old ways means that most significant discoveries are being made elsewhere. If we do not act, $COUNTRY$ risks falling behind in crucial areas like irrigation or military ideas."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.6.OPT1: "Things will work out."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.6.OPT2: "Time to shake up our scientific establishment."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.T: "Thinker Publishes Grand Work"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.D: "With a long and winding title in modernized Latin, one of our foremost and brightest thinkers has, after decades of work, published their principal piece. Spanning many volumes and enough complex scientific formula or philosophical formulations to make anyone's head spin, they have illustrated an impeccable grasp of the world around us. \nEven if we cannot exactly claim to understand what it all means, it will cement $COUNTRY$'s position on the ideological world stage."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.OPT1: "Our magistrates should take note of this thesis on government."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.OPT2: "What a revolutionary view on the development of cultures."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.OPT3: "To even think about deploying this invention on the killing fields."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.OPT4: "What a marvellous new mill design."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.OPT5: "This new rig designs will make our ships far more durable in storms."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.8.g: "A new way of mixing gunpowder that will require half the resources?!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.9.T: "Philosopher Criticizes the Church"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.9.D: "One of $COUNTRY$'s most prominent Enlightenment philosophers has voiced some sharp criticism of the way the church operates in our country. \nWhile initially contained to a small circle of over-educated acquaintances, a pamphlet has now been written and is circulating with the aim of disseminating the philosopher's critique."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.9.OPT1: "We cannot pretend everything about our system is perfect."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.9.OPT2: "If we cannot prove the philosopher wrong, employ stronger measures."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.9.OPT3: "Our censorship office will ensure his ideas aren't heard."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.10.T: "Philosopher Criticizes the Government"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.10.D: "In a display of contempt for order, an Enlightenment philosopher has loudly voiced criticisms of our [Root.GovernmentName] in the public sphere. While it is abundantly clear to anyone that our ways of doing things are superior to anything found elsewhere on the continent or in the world, it is simply not good enough for this philosopher. \nWe could have ignored the criticism, of course, but for some reason people seem to be listening to the philospher, and agreeing with certain points."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.10.OPT1: "Let people talk, they are too far beneath us to understand the complexity of rule."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.10.OPT2: "Let us see if a few choice reforms calms the critics."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.11.T: "Thinker Goes Abroad"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.11.D: "In an apparent act of protest against the lack of stability and the attempt at control of public discourse in our government, one of our foremost thinkers has departed $CAPITAL$ to go abroad. While they are likely to be back - coffee just never tastes as good as the one at home, after all - their departure does not reflect well on our state."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.11.OPT1: "Cover it up as an international exchange of ideas."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.11.OPT2: "Make sure they stay where they are."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.12.T: "Military Thought Suffers Under Rationalism"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.12.D: "With the scientific concepts of empiricism and knowledge spreading into diverse ideologies as rationalism, thinkers are starting to consider many widely accepted military practices as downright barbaric. With public opinion turning against the less savoury aspects of war and bloodshed, military innovation develops slower than it should. Indeed, some even hold pacifist dreams of abolishing warfare althogether, replacing warriors with diplomats."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.12.OPT1: "We must build public support for a strong army."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.12.OPT2: "Ah, to dream of a world where peace is just as viable as warfare."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.T: "Rationalism Aids Trade"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.D: "With the development of rationalist ideas, thinkers have considered the way we have been doing trade for centuries, and found them lacking. By using samples taken from the vast number of transactions made by our merchants in markets and harbours every day, we can attempt to predict the outcome of new economic policies. Some of these ideas seem like they could be quite beneficial!"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.OPT1: "Ask thinkers to suggest some viable trade reforms for $COUNTRY$."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.OPT2: "Wait, flee flow of trade can bring in more money than mercantilism?"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.13.OPT3: "These ideas for new tolls are amazing!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.T: "Mercantilism Questioned"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.D: "For centuries we have adhered to the idea that our country needs to build up treasury reserves by always exporting more value than we import. While this leads to high tariffs that can sometimes contribute to famine and goods shortages, it always ensured we had cash at hand.\nHowever, the new idea seems to be that mercantilism often worsens economic downturns, and reduces the value of our national goods in the long term. While this idea is counterintuitive and quite frankly sounds ridiculous, it has enough supporters to be worth consideration."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.OPT1: "Let us take steps to test out this concept of \"free trade.\""
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.OPT2: "We need to see evidence of this before we put anything into practice."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.14.OPT3: "No, we have to make sure we have the most silver of all the countries!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.15.T: "Advances in Military Practices"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.15.D: "While human universalism and occasionally even pacifism are observable among a large number of thinkers in our country, occasionally one of them will do something useful by making a realisation about military doctrine. Whether it is a technological advancement, a logistical development, or a deeper understanding of soldiers and the execution of warfare, we welcome every new idea that can help us defeat the enemies lurking at our doorstep."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.15.OPT1: "Military practice is more important to us."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.15.OPT2: "Military ideology is more important to us."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.16.T: "War Criticised"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.16.D: "In a recent pamphlet that has just started circulation, a prominent and - more dangerously - popular philosopher has explained in detail why the war our nation is fighting can be seen as unjust. Obviously unfamiliar with the political complexity of the situation, the philosopher could cause great harm to the war effort if public opinion was to turn."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.16.OPT1: "Let the pamphlets spread. People know better than to not support their country's wars."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.16.OPT2: "Do everything in our power to ensure that the philosopher never criticizes $COUNTRY$ again."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.17.T: "Anti-government Radicalism"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.17.D: "The liberal ideas fronted by so many contemporary philosophers have blossomed into an entire movement. Radicals are singing their beliefs in the streets, and state soldiers are viewed with distrust. There hasn't been an open revolt yet, but so many philosophers seem to be trying to instigate exactly that.\nTheir aim is to replace our well-functioning institutions with inefficient liberal bastardisations. It should not be this way, but the thinkers of our country seem to have declared their own ideological war against the state."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.17.OPT1: "Not all their points are useless, and an awful lot of people seem to be supporting them..."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.17.OPT2: "If they want a war, then we will show them the might of a [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.T: "Anti-religious Work Circulates"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.D: "In an utterly distasteful display that not too long ago would be described as heresy, a book detailing the \"wrong\" practices of the church in $COUNTRY$ has been circulating widely for some time. While it is hardly a new reformation, it does pose some challenging questions that the clergy has answered less than well."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT1: "By the Virgin Mary, how dare they!"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT2: "Hardly ninety-five theses. Let's just ignore it."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT3: "God chooses for us all, and He chose for this philosopher to be an ass."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT3.5: "Throw this man out the nearest window NOW!"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT4: "This is an insult to a national institution."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.18.OPT5: "Not too long ago indeed. Burn the philosopher on the stake for heresy!"

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.19.T: "A Footnote to History"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.19.D: "Ah, it seems like not so long ago we worried about criticism from a rampant philosopher. Now that we have seen the errors of our ways, those condemnations hardly seem to matter anymore."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.19.OPT1: "What were we ever concerned about."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.20.T: "The Age of Enlightenment Fades"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.20.D: "As with every age, one must fade to give way for a new. While we may not know what awaits our nation, the past centuries have taught us and the rest of Europe about the very nature of knowledge. Whatever the future brings, we know that we will be better prepared to face the unknown than we have ever been before."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.20.OPT1: "A new age dawns."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.21.T: "The Enlightenment Ends in Revolution"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.21.D: "With the dawn of the revolution, the enlightenment has come to an end. For a century and more the people of Europe have been studying the world to divine its future, and that future is eternal change. Never again will the world be shackled by the way things are and always have been, for now everyone has seen that things can be different. The world works only the way people make it. A new age has dawned, and there is fire on the horizon."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.21.OPT1: "\"We have seen the new world. To arms!\""

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.22.T: "A Literary Salon"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.22.D: "A group of writers and thinkers have started regularly meeting for events where they exchange works, comments and advise. They seem to be helping each other develop coherent arguments and craft masterful literature, while also enjoying each others company and developing ideas.\nNow a true masterpiece has sprung forth from one of these literary salons, an absolutely stunning work possibly unparallelled in our language, at least if the literary critics are to be believed."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.22.OPT1: "Make sure the work is videly circulated."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.22.OPT2: "Present it as the finest our nation has to offer."

 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.23.T: "Academic Society"
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.23.D: "At one of our country's finest academic institutions, a group of self-styled \"scientists\" in search of knowledge has grouped together to develop standardised practices for empirical experimentation. They have published their own handbook, and the early results of their work are promising. \nIt might be that the breakthrough they are looking for would come if we \"encouraged\" them in a particularly useful direction."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.23.OPT1: "Have them look into new production methods."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.23.OPT2: "We need better methods of weighing and proofing."
 FEE_Enlightenment_Events.23.OPT3: "If they can't invent a new cannon, we're not interested."

 FEE_France_Events.1.T: "French Feudalism and the Hundred Years' War"
 FEE_France_Events.1.D: "In many of its aspects the institution of feudalism that defined medieval European life had its origins in France. During the 11th century, however, the “French Feudal Revolution” gave French feudalism a bewildering complexity that existed nowhere else in Europe, as holdings got broken down into ever smaller parts under the emergent classes of seigneurs and castellons. Some regions, such as Toulouse, were brought to heal, but most regions remained largely ruled by small powers with little control from Paris. \n\nThe agony of the Hundred Years' War only increased the confusion, as allegiances between the various vassals fluctuated between the Valois and Plantagenet claimants to the throne. The expense of the war left France unable to enforce feudal obligations on several more prominent vassals, but also underlined the need for centralization to mount an effective defense against foreign aggression. To truly centralize France, however, centuries of tradition, laws, and feudal contracts would, sooner or later, need to be disregarded or destroyed…"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT1: "We must centralize the Kingdom of France!"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT2: "We should remind our vassals of their military obligations!"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT3: "France is too vast to govern, we must preserve the feudal system!"

 FEE_France_Events.2.T: "Law Courts and Parlements"
 FEE_France_Events.2.D: "Power in France does not solely lie with the nobility, who exercise varying levels of independence from Paris. The rising class of lawyers, themselves centered in Paris, conduct much of the administration of the country with little oversight by the monarchy. Due to the inadequate road system, the further away from Paris the courts are, the less they tend to listen to the king. A properly unified administration of the nation must, of course, start here."
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT1: "We shall reign them in by any means necessary!"
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT2: "Let us seek to reason with them: perhaps they will help us on their own"
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT3: "§GLet the King Himself negotiate with these men§!"

 FEE_France_Events.3.T: "Regional Identities in France"
 FEE_France_Events.3.D: "France in the early modern period was a vast and populous land: by some measures the largest and most populous realm in the Western World, and certainly the largest to be claimed by one hereditary monarch, as opposed to the elective monarchy of the more populous but divided Holy Roman Empire. Despite the greater political unity, people in the various regions of France clung to their local identities rather than considering themselves Frenchmen, especially further away from the capital."
 FEE_France_Events.3.OPT1: "It is time we create a France for the French! "
 FEE_France_Events.3.OPT2: "Let the provincials be themselves, I don't care"

 FEE_France_Events.4.T: "Paris Seeks Control"
 FEE_France_Events.4.D: "Now that the war with England is finally over, instead of resting on their victory, it seems the French king has decided to curtail our God-given rights as local rulers and impose his own autocratic will on us. Needless to say, as semi-independent nobles in France, it falls to us to stand for the nobility across France and remind the King from whence his power comes."
 FEE_France_Events.4.OPT1: "We must send a delegation to Paris to assert our rights!"
 FEE_France_Events.4.OPT2: "There is nothing we can really do"

 FEE_France_Events.5.T: "French Feudal Lords Oppose the King"
 FEE_France_Events.5.D: "Seeking to preserve their long-standing feudal prerogatives, the nobility remains a powerful force that largely opposes the recent royal efforts at centralization. Our recent efforts at increasing royal control have caused a delegation of France's most powerful nobles, the semi-independent vassals of the crown, and others to approach the king and demand that our course be reversed."
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT1: "Ignore them!"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT2: "We can afford to reverse course a little"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT3: "Let us attempt to give carrots as well as sticks"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT4: "We must crush this arrogance now! "

 FEE_France_Events.6.T: "King Rejects our Demands"
 FEE_France_Events.6.D: "Our thinly veiled demand for protection of our rights and privileges was dismissed out-of-hand by the King in Paris. "
 FEE_France_Events.6.OPT1: "Perhaps it is time we show the king who really holds power in France…"
 FEE_France_Events.6.OPT2: "We cannot contend with the King of France"

 FEE_France_Events.7.T: "Noble Leaders Arrested!"
 FEE_France_Events.7.D: "In an unexpected turn of events, the French king has responded in the worst way possible to our demands. Arresting some leaders and having others secretly killed, most of the delegation to Paris will not be returning to their extensive land holdings any time soon…"
 FEE_France_Events.7.OPT1: "§Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! will rue the day!"

 FEE_France_Events.8.T: "The Second Estate"
 FEE_France_Events.8.D: "While the nobility of France keep much of the King's attention due to their vast land holdings and military power, the clergy are equally a political force to be reckoned with. At times the French clergy have controlled upwards of 40% of the nation's wealth in endowments that under French law could only increase, never decrease. The French Crown did, at least wrest the power to appoint bishops and cardinals during the medieval Investiture crisis, but the clergy are also a more unified force in opposition to the king than the often-squabbling nobility. If [Root.Monarch.GetName] can leverage what concessions he already has, he can overcome the clergy's resistance to centralization. If not…"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT1: "Seize Clergy Land and Curtail their Influence!"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT2: "Negotiate to gain their support for royal power"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT3: "Do not disturb the clergy"

 FEE_France_Events.9.T: "Clergy Refuses!"
 FEE_France_Events.9.D: "Our attempts at negotiating with the church have been met with arrogant dismissal at the hands of the leading clergymen of the realm. Saying that “your power comes from God just as ours does,” they refuse to relinquish any of their political power in our realm. In response to our attempts to use investiture to leverage influence, they have reignited the feud between church and king over the right to appoint church officials."
 FEE_France_Events.9.OPT1: "Ingrates!"
 FEE_France_Events.9.OPT2: "This has gone far enough - the King of France rules the church!"

 FEE_France_Events.10.T: "Clergy Accepts"
 FEE_France_Events.10.D: "Our overtures were accepted by the Second Estate! Whether through respect for the divine rule of the king, or from fear of the king's power over investiture, prominent clerics led a ceremony of reaffirmation of the French king's authority over the church."
 FEE_France_Events.10.OPT1: "Wonderful!"

 FEE_France_Events.11.T: "Re-Trial of Jeanne D'Arc"
 FEE_France_Events.11.D: "In the year 1429, the Hundred years war was still raging on. With much of Northern France under the Anglo-Burgundian alliance, France was in a weak position. That same year, a peasant girl named Jeanne D'Arc, instructed by voices of angels, went into the royal court of Chinon where king Charles VII, along with many military leaders, to Orleans in order to defeat the English. In the ensuing battle, she earned the nickname 'Maid of Orleans'. Later on in her life, she helped the king be crowned at Reims, and led an unsuccessful attack to reclaim the city of Paris. In the year 1431, she was captured by the Burgundians who sold her to the English, and she was trialed and executed in the city of Rouen.\n\nNow, with the support of the Pope, the university of Paris, and the city of Rouen at our hand, the trial has been re-done, with over 115 witnesses testifying of the maid's purity. This will eliminate any claims that the kingdom was reclaim using a sorceress, thus removing any threats of undermining our legitimacy."
 FEE_France_Events.11.OPT1: "The English fops have been beaten once again."

 FEE_France_Events.12.T: "The Bourgeoisie Request Concessions"
 FEE_France_Events.12.D: "While the nobility and clergy estate have historically been the most powerful in France, the support of the bourgeoisie has always been vital to shore up royal support both within Paris, by far the largest urban center of France, and the outlying cities. The cities, which provide much of the trade wealth of France, bend the knee to neither nobles nor priests. Thus, the bourgeoisie, also known as the Third Estate, controls a disproportionate amount of the wealth that reaches the King's coffers. \nWord of our recent efforts at tighter administration have reached the towns dominated by the Third Estate. They are worried about their rights and privileges that make their cities attractive for trade and business in the first place, and that the crown might seek to repeal them."
 FEE_France_Events.12.OPT1: "They are nothing but lowborns! We govern as we wish!"
 FEE_France_Events.12.OPT2: "We can't do anything against them"

 FEE_France_Events.13.T: "Conflict Between King and Cities"
 FEE_France_Events.13.D: "The Third Estate has decidedly split with the royal authority in Paris over the crown's refusal to continue guaranteeing their rights and privileges. Much of France's small but growing urban population is now suspicious of every move the King makes that might threaten their freedoms. Their fears have caused them to seek support from the outlying dukes and princes of the French periphery. Some bourgeoisie have approached us offering financial support and men. By joining their own resources with ours, we can present a united front against any encroachment from Paris."
 FEE_France_Events.13.OPT1: "We thank them for their support!"
 FEE_France_Events.13.OPT2: "What they say is treason, enough of this!"

 FEE_France_Events.14.T: "A Regular Army"
 FEE_France_Events.14.D: "Throughout the feudal world, the social order could be simplified as “those who fought for all (the nobility), those who prayed for all (the clergy), and those who worked for all (everyone else).” In the 1400s this social order seemed as strong as ever, but in practice warfare was often much less idealistic. The strain on the feudal levies caused by the Hundred Years' War caused the French king to rely ever more heavily on mercenaries. These ragtag armies were often poorly disciplined and cruel to the populace they were supposed to protect. \n\nIn 1445, in the aftermath of the Surrender of Maine, the first real attempt was made to reorganize the army, but mercenaries still dominated the battlefield. Those fiefs ruled directly by the Crown are more than adequate to supply a large standing army if the Crown were to institute more rigorous recruiting; however, the manpower of our vassals is not to be underestimated; nor are the consequences of demanding too much from the French peasantry in the place of mercenaries."
 FEE_France_Events.14.OPT1: "We must remind our nobles of their obligations!"
 FEE_France_Events.14.OPT2: "We can squeeze enough men from our own land"
 FEE_France_Events.14.OPT3: "We should continue relying on mercenaries"

 FEE_France_Events.15.T: "The Provencal Claims"
 FEE_France_Events.15.D: "The Dukes of Provence have proven mightily ambitious in recent years, claiming every vacant throne from Aragon to Jerusalem. When all is said and done, however, they are nothing but a mere scion of the Valois dynasty which rules France, the greatest crown in Europe outside the Emperor himself. This junior part of the family has managed to secure itself de jure French possessions far and wide, has proclaimed themselves a kingdom, and even claims as core territory land that is our own core territory! \n\nNeedless to say, the lofty ambitions of this cadet branch threaten to interfere with ours. While the Anjou princes have tried their best to maintain good relations, perhaps it is in our best interest to reconsider their alliance with us..."
 FEE_France_Events.15.OPT1: "It is time that Provence acknowledges our rule"
 FEE_France_Events.15.OPT2: "We should support our Provencal cousins, not repress them"

 FEE_France_Events.16.T: "The Breton Question"
 FEE_France_Events.16.D: "While the Bretons were included in the old Carolingian Empire, the last bastion of Celtic presence in mainland Europe was quick to regain it's independence. Gifted with deft diplomats, they negotiated our respect for their sovereignty in exchange for neutrality in the Hundred Years' War. Now that the English have been evicted from France, however, this promise of neutrality is no longer relevant. More relevant is the promise of the treaty that Brittany will swear fealty and tribute to the rightful King of France. \n\nTreaty or not, the fact remains that the Bretons occupy land that is rightfully part of the French crown. Whether we choose to act on our legal rights, however, depends on the diplomatic consequences of doing so."
 FEE_France_Events.16.OPT1: "The Bretons must bend the knee to us!"
 FEE_France_Events.16.OPT2: "We must at least receive our rightful tribute"
 FEE_France_Events.16.OPT3: "We have no need of land in Brittany, if they want it they can have it."

 FEE_France_Events.17.T: "France Demands Tribute"
 FEE_France_Events.17.D: "In the Second Treaty of Guerande, we managed to stave off French attempts at annexing us by promising both neutrality in the Hundred Years' War and swearing a nominal fealty to France. Now, envoys from Paris have arrived, claiming that fealty be given. While not an overt demand at subjugation or annexation, it is a claim of overlordship and demand for tribute that weighs seriously on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s mind. Furthermore, the envoys of Paris claim that tribute must be paid, not only for this year but all the years since the treaty was signed over two generations ago."
 FEE_France_Events.17.OPT1: "We have no choice but to accept"
 FEE_France_Events.17.OPT2: "We are independent and owe nothing to France!"

 FEE_France_Events.18.T: "Brittany Accepts"
 FEE_France_Events.18.D: "True to their word, the Duke of Brittany has agreed to pay in full the tribute that he owes us!"
 FEE_France_Events.18.OPT1: "Excellent! We need nothing more from them."

 FEE_France_Events.19.T: "Brittany Refuses"
 FEE_France_Events.19.D: "Valuing their precious coin above their sacred oaths, the Bretons have refuse to pay us tribute!"
 FEE_France_Events.19.OPT1: "They will pay us, one way or another!"

 FEE_France_Events.20.T: "Scottish Mercenaries"
 FEE_France_Events.20.D: "The ties between Scotland and France by 1444 were deep. In addition to the Auld Alliance, Scots have been travelling to France to serve as fighters in the relatively lucrative wars on the continent, seeking wealth and fame, as far back as Charlemagne. Scots mercenaries quickly became known in France for their strength and sometimes mad courage, fighting in several key battles of the Hundred Years' War. Many Scots even of noble blood found service in the French armies. \nA few of the best among the Scots were picked out by Charles VII in 1418 to serve as a special corps, first as frontline troops and later as his royal bodyguard. With our renewed focus on mercenary armies, it is only fair that we give this guard special consideration."
 FEE_France_Events.20.OPT1: "Institutionalize the Scots Guard!"
 FEE_France_Events.20.OPT2: "Nonsense! We do not need them."

 FEE_France_Events.21.T: "Sampiero Corso"
 FEE_France_Events.21.D: "Sampiero Corso was a member of the lower Corsican nobility who sought his fortune as an Italian Condottieri. His exploits would eventually bring him into the service of the French king, for which he was granted the governorship of Aix-en-Provence. In 1553, however, during France's war with Genoa, Sampiero Corso returned to Corsica to lead a rebellion against the Genoese. Although he was successful in securing Corsica's allegiance to France, the island would be returned to Genoa in the peace treaty of Cateau Cambrésis between France and Spain in 1559."
 FEE_France_Events.21.OPT1: "A Corsican rebellion can only be good for us!"

 FEE_France_Events.23.T: "Sampiero Corso"
 FEE_France_Events.23.D: "Living from 1498 to 1567, Sampiero Corso was a Corsican lower noble and soldier. He grew up to become a condottieri, and fought for several paymasters in Italy. Eventually he came into the service of the French king, where his familiarity with Corsica became an advantage to the French efforts in Italy. \nNow it seems that our ruthless enemies in France has chosen to send Sampiero Corso in an attempt to free Corsica for later French occupation!"
 FEE_France_Events.23.OPT1: "Curse that man, and curse all the kings of France!"

 FEE_France_Events.22.T: "Poor Internal Toll System"
 FEE_France_Events.22.D: "In the 17th and 18th century, France had dozens of different laws for how different goods were to be taxed when transported between provinces. To make matters worse, different laws applied to different provinces, causing multiple tolls to be paid by merchants travelling across the country. Not only did this discourage trade and transportation, it made it so that it was often cheaper to import goods from abroad, rather than from a neighboring city.\nIt was also up to local signeurs to apply the taxation laws, which meant that there was no regulation on lords that charged far more than they legally should. In the middle of the 18th century, it was estimated that the cost of transporting 500 livres worth of wine from Muret to Paris was 501 livres, paying for dozens of tolls along the way. The provincial regulations meant that the same amount of salt could cost twenty times as much on one side of a river as on the other."
 FEE_France_Events.22.OPT1: "Administrating a country is no easy task."
 FEE_France_Events.22.OPT2: "We need to reform our toll system!"

 FEE_France_Events.101.T: "Surrender of Maine Setup"
 FEE_France_Events.101.D: "You shouldn't be able to see this hidden event."
 FEE_France_Events.101.OPT1: "Please report it to the team if you see it."

 FEE_France_Events.201.T: "End of Scots Mercenaries"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.T: "The Irmandiño Revolts"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.D: "As the Spanish kingdoms focused on the southwards reconquest of Iberia against the Moors, the traditional northern heartland regions often became neglected. \nGalicia in particular became a hotbed of instability during the latter half of the 15th century, as noble and clerical power were evenly divided in the region, and the poor weather of the Little Ice Age hit Galicia's temperate climate especially hard. As the nobles and clergy squabbled for power, the peasants, lower nobility and merchants were increasingly oppressed, including outright banditry from the nobles and extortion from the priests. \nNow, the Galicians can stand it no longer. At first gathering in secret, the Irmandiños (brotherhood) have now armed the people, who have now risen up in revolt against their oppressors! Targeting the nobility in particular, they have already destroyed dozens of castles, and the nobility have now come to both us and the king of Portugal, desperate for our aid."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.OPT1: "Crush them! Ensure that this never happens again!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.OPT2: "Attempt to negotiate the conflict."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.OPT3: "The Irmandiños have a point! Curtail these criminal nobles!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.T: "Pedro Madruga"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.D: "While not of one of the major noble families of Galicia, and even rumored to be a bastard, Pedro Madruga was a peerless example of the best of medieval knighthood in Galicia. While courteous, even-tempered, and polite, he was also a fierce warrior and became exceptionally skilled in all areas of warfare. Travelling between Castile and Portugal only facilitated his study of different and advanced battle techniques, both on land and at sea. \nDespite all this, he would never have become known were it not for the Irmandiños Revolts. He personally led the victorious royal and noble troops to victory, and was the first to introduce the early modern arquebus to northern Iberia, a factor which no doubt was vital to his victory."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.OPT1: "Invite him to our court! Only the best for the flower of our knighthood."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.OPT2: "He must lead our armies!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.OPT3: "We are in need of leaders for our fleet."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.T: "The Autonomous Regions"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.D: "The question of the various constituent kingdoms of our realm has always been a nagging one for the Catholic monarchs of Iberia. The very fact that many of them were recognized by Popes past as kingdoms in their own right has been a source of contention, as nobility and peasant alike have felt unrepresented in our court, causing widespread resentment. \nWith the Reconquista complete, now is the time to reorganize these outlying regions. [Root.Consort.GetName] has recently come up with the idea of a national Cortes where each region has their own representation. [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, desiring increased power in these regions, would prefer a viceroyalty. This would allow some local rule while still maintaining a dependence on the crown. However, this likely would not satisfy the regions. Most radical of all would be either withdrawing royal authority or attempting to assert total control."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.OPT1: "Establish a National Cortes!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.OPT2: "Appoint Viceroys to these regions."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.OPT3: "These people are more trouble than they are worth - let the local nobles deal with them."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.OPT4: "Am I not the monarch? Curtail these impudent provinces!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.4.T: "Fate of the Fueros"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.4.D: "With the Basque people finally fully integrated into our realm, the question of how best to manage their affairs remains to be settled. Being one of the oldest and most proud kingdoms of Christian Iberia, the former kingdom of Navarra stubbornly guarded its ancient institutions. \nAmong those was the Fueros, the royal charter of Navarra which not only gave Navarra kingdom rank but granted considerable autonomy to its nobles and guaranteed rights to its peasants. Now, representatives of these parties have approached us, requesting that we continue to respect these rights. In exchange, they promise their fullest support for us in other internal and external affairs."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.4.OPT1: "What's good for them is good for us."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.4.OPT2: "It's time for them to recognize who's really in control here."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.T: "The Institutions of Catalonia"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.D: "From it's very beginning as a march of the Carolingian Empire, Catalonia has diverged from the rest of Iberia in maintaining its unique laws and customs, some derived from Salic law, and some even from pre-Roman times. Over time, these customs were codified in the Usatges and later in the four great institutions of Catalonia. These were: the Consell de Cent, Las Corts Generals, the Consulat del Mar, and the Generalitat de Catalunya, representing the nobility, lawyers, traders, and the general estates, respectively. \nThese institutions have been maintained even under the dominion of the crown of Aragon, and now the Catalonians petition us to continue their rights as well."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.OPT1: "Preserve the Institutions."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.OPT2: "Make minimum concessions, but make it clear we mean business."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.OPT3: "Who do these peasants think they are? Our subjects, that's what!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.6.T: "The Catalonian Revolts"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.6.D: "As Spanish monarchs take steps to promote their rule as absolute monarchs over the whole of Iberia, one region in particular has not forgotten their ancient rights and privileges; in fact, many there still believe that those privileges are theirs by right. The Institutions of Catalonia have become a rallying standard for the preservation of rights in the face of royal absolutism. \nEven more infuriating to the Catalonians is the increasingly outward focus of the Spanish crown, with quests for the new world and domination of Europe leaving their Mediterranean-focused and trade-dependent cities behind. Now, the Catalonians are demanding their ancient rights be encoded in an inviolable Constitution, a thing heretofore unheard of in the Iberian kingdoms. \nIf we do not act quickly, this simmering resentment might boil into outright revolt. Groups of militia known as “El Segadores” have already been gathering arms and rousing the populace with fiery invectives against our \"tyranny\""
 FEE_Iberia_Events.6.OPT1: "Concede to the Constitutionalists."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.6.OPT2: "The Catalonians have interfered with the state for long enough! Crush them!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.7.T: "Catalonia Defies [From.GetAdjective] Oppressors!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.7.D: "The Catalan people of Catalonia have had enough of the rule of our hated enemies in §Y[From.GetName]§! and have broken free! Should we ally with this fledgling state to support their independence war?"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.7.OPT1: "We must show them our support!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.7.OPT2: "This is not our war."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.T: "The Great Earthquake of 1755"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.D: "[227.GetName] is in ruins! On All Saints' Day 1755, one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded struck just 200 kilometers off the coast of Portugal, rocking the nation completely. Portugal was typically earthquake-prone, [227.GetName] in particular having been severely damaged before in prior disasters. This earthquake proved to be like no other though, the death toll estimated to be about 40,000 and the great capital of Portugal destroyed, through earthquake, tsunami or fire. The earthquake itself was reported to have created crevices 5 metres wide in the city centre. Many retreated to the open spaces of the docks, to see the sea retreat to display a barren, muddy plain. Roughly an hour after the earthquake, a colossal tsunami ripped through [227.GetName] up the River Tejo, destroying all in its path. The shaking and shockwaves from the earthquake and its subsequent tsunami knocked over all varieties of candle and set the city ablaze, turning the already ruined city into a firestorm. \nBy the time the disaster was over, 85% of [227.GetName] was destroyed and countless works of art, literature, architecture and history were lost. King Joseph I and his court were, by sheer luck, out of [227.GetName] due to his daughter's wish to spend All Saints' Day away from the capital. King Joseph himself developed claustrophobia due to the tragedy, and was terrified of living within walls for the rest of his life, instead opting to move the court to a mass of tents on the outskirts of [227.GetName]. The prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal used this to gain power, leveraging the earthquake to take control of the royal court, and establish himself as the primary political figure in Portugal through his handling of the disaster."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.OPT1: "[227.GetName] shall be ruins forever more."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.OPT2: "Bury the Dead and heal the Living!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.OPT3: "Restore order by any means necessary!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.9.T: "Foundations of Seismology"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.9.D: "The destruction of [227.GetName] was a great tragedy, but life goes on. We learn from our mistakes and better ourselves and thus we must learn from this too. There is a great deal of material to study here. Let us create a new school of the sciences, dedicated to studying these earthquakes."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.9.OPT1: "Knowledge can always be gained from suffering. In future we may stop such great losses."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.T: "Jimenez de Cisneros"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.D: "Initially starting as a humble Franciscan friar, Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros was thrown in prison for his disagreements with the archbishop of Toledo (who is no stranger to meddling in our own affairs as well!). Upon his release, Jimenez devoted his life to reforming the church, gaining such a reputation for holiness that he became archbishop himself, as well as personal confessor of Isabella de Castilla and cardinal. \nConvoking long-overdue synods, Jimenez rooted out most, if not all, clerical corruption in Spain. Beyond this, however, he sponsored schools for the laity, oversaw the flooding of Castilian markets with translated devotional texts, and spread a new school of mystical through in clergy and laity alike. Essentially, his reforms were almost single-handedly responsible for reviving the piety of the Spanish people, purging corruption, and making Spain into the devout Catholic bastion of the early modern world, unlike any other in the world."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.OPT1: "Embrace these Reforms!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.OPT2: "Let us show moderation..."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.OPT3: "Reforms? Pah! Everything is fine!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.11.T: "University of Alcala"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.11.D: "The brainchild of Jimenez de Cisneros, a new university at Alcala was opened to produce the best educated clergy in the world, and became known especially for its studies of Biblical languages and skill at translating them. In addition, it harmonized Renaissance humanist ideas with solid Catholic dogma in a way no other clerical school did. During the Reformation years, it would grow to become a powerhouse of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, sending trained priests to hold back reformers in Ireland, France, and Italy as well as producing many missionaries for Spain's overseas territories."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.11.OPT1: "We will provide whatever this school needs!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.11.OPT2: "The church should be helping our treasury, not the other way around!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.T: "On the Donation of Constantine"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.D: "Since at least the 8th century, the Catholic Popes have made repeated reference to the \"Donation of Constantine\" said to be an imperial decree of the ancient Emperor Constantine himself, giving the Pope political authority over Western Rome as well as spiritual power. \nIndeed, it is this very claim to authority under the doctrine of Translatio Imperii that provides legitimacy for the Holy Roman Empire itself! \nThe legitimacy of the Donation has been questioned since the 11th century for various reasons. Now, however, a philological scholar in our own court has completed a years-long analysis of what is said to be the source document for this sweeping claim to power. By pointing out linguistic inconsistencies, he makes a convincing proof that the document is, in fact, a reprehensible forgery. Indeed, the scholar, named Lorenzo Valla, claims the forgery is so obvious that even the current Pope must be complicit to use it so brazenly. \nMaking this known to the world, however, given the great importance that the Donation has assumed, would make a lot of enemies, and risks undermining the church itself! At the same time, it could shore up our own claims in Italy… \nPredictably, the Inquisition has demanded we turn Valla over to be tried for heresy. How shall we proceed?"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.OPT1: "Even the Pope cannot partake in lies!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.OPT2: "We can afford to compromise here"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.OPT3: "Hand over this charlatan to the Inquisition!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.OPT3.tt: "The holy father must remain supreme!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.tt: "§YEvery Catholic Country's§!: Opinion of §Y[PAP.GetName]§! changed by §R-30§! \n§Y[PAP.GetName]'s§! opinion of §YEvery Catholic Country§! changed by §R-30§!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.T: "Juan de Avila"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.D: "Building on the reforms of Jimenez de Cisneros, priest Juan de Avila became a staunch advocate for the reform of the clergy, almost forseeing the religious turmoil to come due to clergy corruption. Selling his entire inherited wealth to benefit the poor as an example, he undertook a remarkable journey as an itinerant preacher through Andalusia, ministering to the poor and railing against clergy abuses, especially the practice of nobility of setting up their children in a comfortable lifestyle as priests. Understandably them, his preaching of revival (recogimiento) led to resentment among some powerful families. \nNow, certain noble families have captured him and dragged him before the Royal Inquisition, demanding he recant and be silenced."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.OPT1: "He only speaks the truth! Give him a position here to make his call nationwide!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.OPT2: "Let him go free and continue his pilgrimage."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.OPT3: "He is guilty of heresy for questioning the church!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.14.T: "Reforming the Benedictine Order"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.14.D: "The oldest of all the monastic orders, the Benedictines have thrived throughout Europe, but especially in Spain. The independence of individual monasteries historically set them apart from their competitors and fostered a more austere and purer lifestyle, but it has also introduced disunity and confusion in their ranks. \nNow, as we confront the reformation, it is imperative that we assist these holy men in reaffirming their original vows and make the Order into a worthy example for our own more official holy orders."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.14.OPT1: "Sponsor the Benedictines!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.14.OPT2: "They can take responsibility for themselves!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.15.T: "Reform among the Franciscans"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.15.D: "Reacting to a gradual slackening within the Franciscan Order, a group of monks in Andalusia has begun to advocate strongly for a revival of strict adherence to the Franciscan vows, travelling the countryside barefoot to prove their point. \nThese monks have found an able leader in Pedro de Alcantara. An austere mystic, rumor has it he only sleeps two hours a day. Under his rule, the discalced (barefoot) movement has started to gain massive popular support."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.15.OPT1: "Reform the whole Franciscan Order to be an example to the world!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.15.OPT3: "These men are blind fanatics! Arrest them!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.16.T: "The Jesuits and the Ministry of Teaching"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.16.D: "The new Jesuit order founded by Ignatius de Loyola has taken both Catholics and Protestants by surprise with its new-found tenacity, zeal, and above all effectiveness. Unique among all holy orders was their vow to accept any and all missions given by the Pope in Rome. This combined with an acute awareness of the importance of Catholic education has made them the spearhead of the Counter-Reformation. Protestants have even taken to calling them the \"shock troops of the pope.\" Indeed, they have even become renowned experts of spycraft as they are trained to effortlessly blend in and evangelize even in kingdoms hostile to the Pope. \nTheir ambitious mission, to found Catholic schools all over Europe, and indeed the world, and staff those schools with the best and brightest minds in all fields, could potentially make them a potent force for us! However, as of now their ambitious outstrip their resources. Besides, with unmatched zeal and papal control and sanction comes great power, perhaps eventually too great for the Most Catholic Monarch of Spain to handle."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.16.OPT1: "Let us generously fund Jesuit Expansion!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.16.OPT2: "Let us ensure the Jesuits know their place."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.17.T: "Luis de Molina"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.17.D: "As Protestant, Reformed, and Catholic compete in Europe in an increasingly entangled and confusing Reformation, various debates concerning the freedom of the will and its seeming opposition to the power of God have filtered from the debates between reformers into the Catholic church as well. \nOne Spanish priest, Luis de Molina, has undertaken to resolve this issue and ensure that out Holy Church does not get torn apart yet again by the spirit of the Reformation. His treatise On the Harmony of the Free Will with the Gift of Grace, Divine Foreknowledge, Providence, Predestination, and Reprobation became the foundation for so-called \"Molinism,\" which though never officially approved by the Pope, has at least received Rome's tacit approval."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.17.OPT1: "Embrace Molinism."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.17.OPT2: "Let the Holy Father decide!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.17.OPT3: "Ignore the Issue..."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.T: "Jesuit Plot Uncovered!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.D: "The Societas Jesu has been extremely successful in its mission of conversion, education, and subversion, exploding onto the scene of the Age of Reformation like an artillery barrage upon those who would see the Catholic church fall. Additionally, as their success has grown, so to has their independence, and even the Pope to whom they still swear obedience exercises little control over them. \nNow, murmuring rumors about a sinister side of the Jesuits seem to have been borne out: a former Jesuit has brought to light a terrifying book: allegedly a compilation of carefully laid plans to overthrow monarchies throughout Europe and even destroy the Papacy itself! \nWhile it is unclear the extent to which this is true, it is true that the Jesuits' iron grip on childhood education gives it much power, and public opinion has started to shift decidedly against them. Even the Papacy is taking steps to condemn and possibly dismantle the Order."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.OPT1: "Ignore these vile rumors!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.OPT2: "It's time we curtail the power of the Order!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.T: "The Poor Laws"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.D: "Despite the many differences between the various branches of the Reformation, one thing all sides agree on is how disgraceful it is for any society to have large numbers of neglected poor, forced to beg to survive. \nMany Protestant and Reformed realms have already sought to reform charity as the traditional church charity structure loses its standing and resources, seeking to put extensive governmentfunded measures in place instead. The time has come for us to make a decision on whether to follow them or not."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.OPT1: "Pass the Poor Laws."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.OPT2: "Do Not!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.T: "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.D: "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo was the first viceroy of Naples to effectively govern the kingdom on behalf of the Spanish crown. While issuing grand construction projects and modernizing the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government. \nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.OPT1: "His work in Naples makes the Crown proud."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.OPT2: "His talent should be used in other parts of our empire."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.1.T: "Albrecht Durer"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.1.D: "Albrecht Dürer was a painter, printmaker, and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Dürer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. He made his mark in many areas of art, but especially in his woodcuts of religious scenes, landscape paintings, and proportionality in art. He was later commemorated by the Lutheran church, and was seen as one of the foremost artists of the Northern Renaissance."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.1.OPT1: "A true Renaissance man."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.2.T: "Jewish Presence in the Empire"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.2.D: "While Jews were granted limited protection by Emperors during the 14th century, the Hussite Wars and other religious conflicts in the 15th signaled a renewed persecution of Jews throughout the Empire. Medieval attitudes that ascribed all kinds of evils to the Jewish communities intensified in many places in Germany. At the same time, they remain vital contributors to local economies. Additionally, the spread of the Renaissance and humanism has given rise to new attitudes of tolerance."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.2.OPT1: "“Tolerance” might be worth it, if only for the money these. people bring"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.2.OPT2: "Who actually thinks we can trust them? Evict them and. confiscate their wealth!"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.2.OPT3: "Tolerance is the way of the future, let us take Jewish refugees in!"

	FEE_HRE_Minors.3.T: "The Diet of Worms"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.3.D: "While, initially, the preachings of Martin Luther were seen as just another local heresy to be condemned and uprooted, the explosion of pamphlets, proselytes, and protests have made the Protestant movement too large to ignore. Hoping to head off the controversy, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to convene an unofficial Diet, essentially putting Luther on trial for his beliefs. Despite his delay tactics, Luther eventually was forced to definitively say whether he would recant his beliefs or not. Famously, he responded\nwith “I neither can nor will retract anything; for it cannot be either safe or honest for a Christian to speak against his conscience. Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise; God help me! Amen”"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.3.OPT1: "He must be condemned as a heretic."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.3.OPT2: "Condemning him now is too risky - let him go."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.4.T: "Johannes Gutenberg"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.4.D: "A goldsmith, tinkerer, and inventor, Gutenberg made his mark on Western civilization by being the first to introduce the movable type printing press to Europe. Arguably the most important invention in history prior to the steam engine, the printing press single-handedly reshaped European society."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.4.OPT1: "This man must be our advisor."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.5.T: "The Depression of the 16th Century"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.5.D: "As Western Europe begins to bring wealth from the New World and open up maritime trade to the Orient, the traditional wealth of German states dried up and the states of the Empire entered a prolonged depression. The overland routes between Italy and Germany fell into disuse and the trade in north Germany fell further and further behind that of the Atlantic powers. Even the great house of the Fuggers, making loans on the basis of ongoing German prosperity, found themselves overstretched and collapsed into bankruptcy. People began to leave the onceprosperous German cities, many for the booming cities of the Low Countries. "
	FEE_HRE_Minors.5.OPT1: "We shall recover… eventually."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.6.T: "Martin Luther in Hiding"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.6.D: "Despite Luther's ringing defense of his faith in the Bible, the Diet of Worms proclaimed him a heretic. A price was laid on his head, giving any Imperial citizen free license to kill Luther. Elector [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, was not about to let this happen. Determined to save the fledgling Reformation while he/she still could, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had him “ambushed” by masked men and spirited away to one of his castles, where no one would find him.\nLuther used the time well, translating the Bible into German directly from the original Greek, writing hymns, and coining the five key tenets of the Reformation: Sola Scriptura, Sola Gratia, Sola Fide, Solus Christus, and Soli Deo Gloria. These five “Sola's” would become the rallying cry of the reformation all over Europe."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.6.OPT1: "God has willed it."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.6.OPT2: "Protect him!"

	FEE_HRE_Minors.7.T: "The Question of the Imperial Navy"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.7.D: "The Holy Roman Empire has always been defined by two things: its decentralization and independence of princes, and its focus on internal, mainly German, affairs. As such, the Empire has never had the need or the resources to develop an Imperial Navy.\nHowever, when [Root.GetName] began to invest its own meager resources into a competitive navy, the Emperor did not take long to take note of the development. Now, a diplomat from the Emperor's court has arrived in [Root.GetName] with an interesting proposal.\nPointing out the obvious truth, the Imperial diplomat argued that, since we have invested into expensive warships, our defensive capabilities on land may be sadly lacking in comparison to our neighbors. At the same time, the Emperor has a strong land army but little in the way of a navy. If we were to join forces with the Emperor and place our navy at his disposal should he need it, he would be more than willing to protect us on land in return."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.7.OPT1: "A splendid proposition."
	FEE_HRE_Minors.7.OPT2: "We are better off alone."

	FEE_HRE_Minors.8.T: "Industrialization in the Rhineland"
	FEE_HRE_Minors.8.D: "While Britain may have led the way in its abundance of coal, the densely-populated and resource-rich ground of the Rhineland is in an excellent position to compete. And compete we must. Our small size relative to the great European powers means we must find a niche in the emerging international market or become merely a commodity ourselves to be taken, traded, and sold to the highest bidder. The reforms necessary to bring about needed change, and the speed at which they must be done, may make some people uncomfortable, however."

Today a papal representative has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], to privately discuss matters of Prague and the throne of Bohemia - it could be [HUN.Monarch.GetName]'s, for the price of removing the Hussites from Bohemia. Now at the same time, it is known that Austria has grown fed-up with Hussite raids into Austrian lands and was beginning to mobilize troops to the Bohemian border. \nCould this be our time to capitalise on this chaos?"

 FEE_Italy_Events.1.T: "The Wars of Italy"
 FEE_Italy_Events.1.D: "The Italian peninsula of the Middle Ages was divided between the fragmented north, split into numerous fiefs and city-states under the nominal sovereignty of the Holy Roman Emperor, the Kingdoms of Sicily and Naples in the south, and the Papal State that had jurisdiction over parts of central Italy. The fourteenth century was a period of consolidation for the biggest powers of Italy, especially for Milan, Venice, Florence, and the Pope, who expanded their dominions over the smaller cities. The friction that arose from these expansions continued into the next century and culminated with the Lombard Wars between Milan and Venice. Following the signing of the Peace of Lodi in 1454, a balance emerged between the five regional powers: the Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Venice, the Papal State, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Republic of Florence. A mutual defence pact, the Italian League, was formed between them and the four decades that followed were characterized by diplomatic and military balance, overseen by Lorenzo de' Medici. Conflicts were kept small and regionalized, while the Renaissance was flourishing in all Italian centers of culture. This balance was however broken in the last decade of the century, following the death of the Florentine statesman. The spark for the First Italian War was the dynastic succession of the duchy of Milan. \nThe many wars that shaped the Italian peninsula from 1494 on saw the introduction of many significant advances in military technology and tactics, including field artillery, muskets, and combined tactics."

 FEE_Italy_Events.1.OPT5: "We'll keep out of any conflict"

 FEE_Italy_Events.2.T: "Improve the Infantry"
 FEE_Italy_Events.2.D: "The infantry saw profound evolutions during the Italian wars, transforming from a predominantly armed force with pikes and halberds to a more flexible arrangement of arquebusiers, pikemen and other specialties. While the first part of the wars saw the prevalence of Swiss mercenaries and lansquenets, groups with firearms established themselves from 16th century. \n\nIn 1503, a skirmish between French and Spanish forces represented the first demonstration of the usefulness of arquebuses in battle. The Spanish general Gonzalo de Codoba feigned a retreat, attracting a contingent of men-at-arms between two groups of his arquebusiers. As the French army found themselves among the shooters, volleys of bullets hit them hard in both flanks. Before the French could attack the vulnerable arquebusiers, a Spanish cavalry charge broke the French forces and forced them to retreat. While the French army was in rout, the Spanish enemies inflicted heavy losses on it. \n\nThe success of the use of firearms in the Italian wars led Niccolò Machiavelli, often described as an enemy of the use of the arquebuses, to write in his treatise On the art of war that all citizens of a city should know how to shoot with a pistol."
 FEE_Italy_Events.2.OPT1: "Refine the Musketeers!"

 FEE_Italy_Events.3.T: "Cavalry, to Charge!"
 FEE_Italy_Events.3.D: "Heavy cavalry - the latest evolution of medieval armored knights - remained the protagonist in the battlefields of the Italian wars. The French gendarmes generally proved to be the most effective against the horse troops of the other states, mainly because of the excellent horses in their possession. The Spaniards used a type of cavalry called Jinete in their sorties."
 FEE_Italy_Events.3.OPT1: "To Charge!"

 FEE_Italy_Events.4.T: "Artillery must be prefectioned"
 FEE_Italy_Events.4.D: "The Italian wars saw artillery, especially field artillery, take on an indispensable role in any first-rate army. Charles VIII, during his invasion of Italy, brought with him a truly mobile siege procession, consisting of culverins and bombards mounted on wheeled trolleys, which could be deployed against an enemy fortress immediately upon arrival. The French siege arsenal brought with it several technological innovations. Charles's army used horses to pull cannons rather than the oxen typically used up to that time. Furthermore, French cannons, forged in the same methods used to produce bronze bells, boasted a previously unknown lightness and mobility. The most important improvement of the French however was the creation of iron cannonballs. Before the Italian wars, artillery fired stone balls that often shattered upon impact. The invention of water mills allowed the operation of furnaces with a temperature sufficient to melt the iron in order to make cannon balls. With this technology, Charles's army could conquer, within a few hours, walls and castles that had previously resisted sieges for months or even years. \n\nThe armies of the Italian wars were led by a great variety of commanders, from mercenaries to noble leaders up to the king himself."
 FEE_Italy_Events.4.OPT1: "Tear them down!"

 FEE_Italy_Events.5.T: "We will be safe behind our Forts"
 FEE_Italy_Events.5.D: "Most of the fighting that took place during the Italian wars took place during the sieges. That of the first descent of Charles VIII in Italy is traditionally considered the initial date of the development of the fortification to the modern, which will lead to the birth of increasingly complex fortified systems during the subsequent invasions. The army of Charles VIII in fact had a modern artillery in front of which many antiquated medieval castles had to succumb. These systems will soon spread throughout Europe, initially by Italian engineers."
 FEE_Italy_Events.5.OPT1: "They won't fall"

FEE_Italy_Events.6.T: "Diplomatic Solutions"
FEE_Italy_Events.6.D: "Though the Italian wars raged and most states were caught in the conflict in some capacity, some managed to keep out of the conflict. Though small in size and numbers, the miniscule states and princedoms of the Italian peninsula managed to keep out of the wars and hold their fragile independence intact. This set a precedent in the Italian cities like Monaco and San Marino, where the latter got involved in the Napoleonic Wars. \nNapoleon promised to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic even so far as offering to extend its territory according to its needs. While grateful for the former, the offer of territorial expansion was politely declined by San Marino and the thunders of war was ultimately never brought upon San Marino."

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.2.D: "Situated perfectly at the confluence of the Baltic Sea, English Channel, and Rhine River trade routes, Amsterdam grew in importance and influence throughout the 15th century. As the Hanseatic League to the east began to lose coherence, merchants from Amsterdam increasingly filled the vacuum in the Baltic Sea. The growing population of the Lowlands also led to an increased demand for grain from the Baltic shores, since land could no longer be reclaimed fast enough to keep up with demand for food. \nThe upshot of all this was that Amsterdam would become the primary port in Europe for the important and distribution of grain from the Baltic."

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.3.D: "The area of Frisian has long been known for its “Frisian Freedom,” the near-complete absence of feudalism and serfdom that was known almost nowhere else in the world during the Middle Ages. However, external forces gradually eroded the Frisian Freedom through military efforts or even outright buying off of local power brokers. By 1498, the Freedom was all but gone, and Imperial forces would occupy Frisia. \nIt wouldn't take long before this occupation and revocation of ancient freedoms, stemming from the time of Charlemagne himself, would be rejected by the population. Things came to a head when the Black Band, a mercenary company stationed to maintain order, extracted “payment” by looting local villages."

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.5.T: "La Furia Espanola"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.5.D: "During the Eighty Years' War, or Dutch Revolt, the many Spanish tercios of the Army of Flanders under Julian Romero, employed to purge the anti-Catholic heresy and bring the rebel provinces of Holland and Zeeland back into line were growing restless. They were weary of endless fighting with little to no rest, and frustrated at their lack of pay by the Spanish Crown. The troops had their pay delayed due to Spain's recent declaration of bankruptcy, leading to the bankers refusing to authorise payment until they had negotiated with Phillip II. This meant that the King had to send the physical money by sea, which was much more perilous. To make matters worse, 400,000 florins intended for the soldiers were seized by the English after the ships carrying them were forced to take refuge in English ports during a storm. This pushed the tercios too far. They decided to find their pay for themselves, as was a time old tradition, by sacking a major city. They chose the de facto capital of the Seventeen Provinces at the time, Antwerp, from which to take what they were owed. This was due to the treachery of the Spanish commander of Antwerp Citadel, Sancho d'Avila. He attempted to convince the commander of the garrison of German mercenaries to deliver the city into Spanish hands. This, however, had the opposite effect. The Germans began to improvise defences against the Spaniards and a day before the mutinying tercios arrived, 6,000 Walloon mercenaries were let into the city to help defend it. This was not enough, unfortunately for the city and its citizens. The defences were overrun by the professionally trained soldiers and the Walloon troops not only failed to defend the city, but even fled or participated in the looting of Antwerp. The few remaining Germans and the civilians were massacred, some 7,000 lives lost."

This is truly a death knell for Antwerp and a black day for our people."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.1.T: "Province Named Generality Lands"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.1.D: "Due to the challenges of administrating the population of it, the States-General has decided to name the region Generaliteitslande, or \"Generality Lands.\" This means that instead of being subject to one of the seven United Provinces, it will be governed directly by the States-General itself. \nThese regions are not represented in the central government - which might be best, considering their beliefs - and have no States-Provincial of their own.\n\nOne day we might have reason to let them be represented and govern themselves, but for now holding them as a dependent territory is best."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.1.OPT1: "The States-General votes unanimously in favor."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.2.T: "Province Achieves Representation"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.2.D: "After showing signs of development and stability, the region of it has finally been granted the right to its own administration. This comes with the responsibility of sending representatives to the States-General, and in time the former Generality Lands might even earn its own States-Provincial!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.2.OPT1: "We are all people of the Netherlands, after all."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.3.T: "Arrival in Indonesia"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.3.D: "Our expedition to the East Indies has finally arrived! This morning we received news that after careful negotiations with the Sultan of Banten that our brave merchants and explorers have established a trading post there. Our merchants have also received an offer from the Prince of Jayakarta to construct a warehouse nearby. Should we accept? "
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.3.OPT1: "We shall take the good Prince up on his offer."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.3.OPT2: "We should steer clear of this. "

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.4.T: "Founding of Batavia"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.4.D: "We have had many trading ports in Asia since the VOC were given a monopoly over trade in Asia. One of our biggest was the warehouse at Jayakarta, however after long tensions with the English and the Natives of the region, the natives attempted to destroy the warehouses. In retaliation, the brave troops of the East India Company razed Jayakarta to the ground! However, VOC officials are now proposing to construct an organised Dutch city upon its ruins called Batavia and are asking for a grant."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.9.T: "The Supreme Court of Holland"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.9.D: "While Den Haag has long served as the administrative center of the Hollanders, the steady increase of the region in population, wealth, and influence has required ever more legal protections and effective administration of justice, a need which has outgrown our institutions' ability to provide it. Especially important for an area so dependent on trade is the consistent and meaningful enforcement of contracts and the protection of property rights. These are two cornerstones of any successful economy. \nTo that end, it has been proposed that a new standardized court system be set up, one that not only is independent over legal matters in our lands, but also regulates commerce on the high seas going through our ports. \nThe flagship of this new court system would be in the Hague, the better to maintain independence from the merchant interests in fast-growing Amsterdam or the nobility interests further inland. "
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.9.OPT1: "Let the Hague be an example to the rest of the world!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.10.T: "The Corneliszoon Sawmill"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.10.D: "While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the sawmill was invented in Holland, since sawmills have existed since Roman times, Cornelis Corneliszoon was the first to craft a round saw blade that was attached via a pitman arm onto a windmill. This vastly increased the speed and efficiency at which a sawmill operated, and allowed for a rapid expansion of Dutch maritime capability."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.10.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.11.T: "Defensive Reforms"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.11.D: "Since the Middle Ages, the Dutch have been unique in the world for their ability to build great dikes, walls to keep out the sea itself. More recently, wars of independence and the strategic vulnerability of our lands have trained us in the arts of building state-of-the-art forts on our frontiers. The invention of the bastion is just the latest in the European-wide arms race between defense and offense. We must be prepared to keep up to maintain our edge."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.12.D: "While Michiel de Ruyter has already had a full and illustrious career, serving everything from a musket under Maurice of Nassau to a pirate-hunter aboard privately-owned ships, his latest assignment has brought him fully to our attention. \nWhile assigned as captain of a state-owned man-of-war hunting Portuguese raiders, he distinguished himself in combat against a combined Spanish and Portuguese fleet. \nThere, despite an cautious nature on land, he showed exemplary boldness and steadfastness in the face of dangerous undertakings. He would go down in history as one of the most skilled naval leaders in Dutch history."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.12.OPT1: "He shall be made an admiral!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.13.T: "A Daring Attack"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.13.D: "However regrettable the circumstances may or may not be, we find ourselves at war with the English over the question of naval supremacy. However, word has been leaked that the English have been forced to lay in their fleet for repairs due to budget concerns. \nTo most navies, this would put them safely out of reach for repairs. But we will not be so easily discouraged. One of our leading politicians, working in conjunction with one of our best admirals, has devised a bold operation the likes of which has never been attempted against the English navy. He proposes to sail our navy into the mouth of the Thames itself, engage the fortifications there directly and attack the English fleet while it is unable to move or defend itself."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.13.OPT1: "Fortune favors the bold!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.14.T: "Raid on the Medway"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.14.D: "Utter disaster has befallen our glorious fleet! Despite ample warning by our spies in Holland, the Naval Board completely discounted the idea that the Dutch would dare launch an attack into the Thames itself. Imagine our shock, then, when a morning fog lifted to reveal the horrible sight of the entire Dutch navy bearing down on the Thames! \nhe Dutch broke through out defensive chains and burned many of our finest ships, even capturing the flagship itself! Many prominent voices begin to fear that a defeat of this scale might prove the undoing of the whole kingdom. The city of London has flown into a panic of the now-dreaded Dutch! And well they might, for this will go down in history as the worst defeat ever suffered by the Royal Navy, and one of the worst in all our military history!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.15.T: "Raid on the Medway"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.15.D: "Totally unprepared for our bold move, we have inflicted nothing short of catastrophe on the enemy navy!

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.16.T: "Dutch Settlers at the Cape"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.16.D: "nitially, the only Dutch presence at the Cape of Good Hope was a VOC supply post for ships on the way to the Indies. It was never thought that it would become a destination for Dutch settlers; indeed, for much of the history of the Republic we have been a destination for immigrants rather than a source of emigration. \nLately, however, rumors of rich farmland and a labor shortage in the VOC has encourage a rare outpouring of Dutch migration there. Dutch Calvinists, mostly farmers from the interior Netherlands where trade wealth wasn't as abundant as on the coast, were the majority of the immigrants, but they were quickly followed by Germans and French Huguenots as well. Soon, the immigrants even ventured out beyond the Cape, which itself was becoming a developed city in its own right. \nDespite this influx, the VOC has been reticent to invest any more into the well-being of the colony, treating it as little more than a glorified campsite."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.16.OPT1: "Encourage the settlers of Cape Town!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.16.OPT2: "Encourage the settlement of the hinterlands!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.16.OPT3: "This is a matter for the VOC alone"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.17.T: "The Grand Alliance"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.17.D: "It has been a geopolitical constant of Europe that France, with its huge population, fertile soil, and absolutist rule has been the most powerful nation in Western Europe, if not all of the European continent. \nWith the weakening of the Holy Roman Emperor, long the counterweight to French ambitious, by religious wars, and even rumors of a Franco-Ottoman alliance, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided that it is high time the powers of western Europe formalize their intention to contain France. Accordingly, all nations with an interest in doing so shall receive invitations to meet in the Hague and form a Grand Alliance against the French."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.17.OPT1: "Let the Treaty be signed!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.17.OPT2: "On second thought, we can handle this ourselves"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.18.T: "Rembrandt"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.18.D: "Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, commonly known simply as Rembrandt, was a Dutch painter, printmaker, and draughtsman from Leiden. An innovator in all three distinct art media, he is widely considered one of the greatest artists in history and single-handedly embodied the Dutch Golden Age of the arts. He became famous for his intimate and brooding self-portraits, prints of scenes from the Bible, and his pioneering work in the technique of etching. \nIn opposition to the prevailing Baroque style of the age, and to the art styles which preceded them, Rembrandt's paintings, like those of other Dutch masters, presented ordinary life scenes as objects of high art. This “democratization” of art showed such empathy for ordinary human life that he was called “one of the great prophets of civilization."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.18.OPT1: "A true master of the arts!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.19.T: "Huguenot Refugees"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.19.D: "The relatively tolerant order established in France after the French Wars of Religion is rapidly deteriorating. The rise of absolutism in our larger neighbor has led to the revocation of legal protections for the French minority of Protestants known as Huguenots. In addition, the continued actions of the Inquisition in Spain and religious conflicts ongoing in Germany have made our Republic into an island of peace and stability. While constant conflict in Europe results in rampant poverty, in Amsterdam there are always jobs! \nNaturally, these people of all faiths wish to seek a better life in our trading cities."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.19.OPT1: "By all means, let them in!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.19.OPT2: "They would only bring all their problems here"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.20.T: "Dike Piercing"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.20.D: "Come my friends, the Dutch are going to war! It is likely that we go to our doom. The last march of the Dutch!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.20.OPT1: "Break the dikes! Release the water!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.20.OPT2: "Our business is to fight, not flee!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.21.T: "Lack of Investment in Manufacturing "
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.21.D: "Our dominance of the global trade networks has brought unprecedented wealth to our shores. Even as other nations begin to copy our techniques for trade and ship-building, we ourselves have become complacent. Many merchants seem content to continue accruing profit from existing trade routes, heedless of the looming competition, while our investors find foreign opportunities more lucrative than our own nation swamped in excess capital. \nOur emphasis on trade has led us this far, but an investment into our nations manufacturing capacity is critical if we are to avoid being left behind by other nations. Alternatively, some suggest that we could pawn our gains from trade back into the finances markets which so helped us before, that we may create a self-reinforcing cycle of financial growth without additional spending or investment."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.21.OPT1: "The world is changing, and industry is the future"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.21.OPT2: "The investment of capital is core to a nation's success"

 FEE_Poland_Events.1.D: "The shattering of the unity of Latin Christendom by the Reformation is in full swing. Even among those monarchs that have stayed true to the Catholic faith, the division in Christendom ushered in a period of great adjustment. In Eastern Europe, the division between Catholic and Orthodox meant a long tradition of believers who officially considered each other heretics living side-by-side. More than anywhere else, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has embraced fundamental ideas of religious tolerance and personal freedom. To further these ideals in a time of unrest, King [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proposed a Treaty of Union between Catholic and Orthodox. This Union would effectively outflank Protestantism by the acceptance of Papal authority by the entrenched Orthodox clergy in return for a guarantee of freedom to practice Orthodox rituals. However, if we do this, many in our realm who now practice Catholicism for political gain may revert to their old faith, making the Orthodox more influential than previously thought..."

The laws stated that the king required the approval of the nobles when issuing new laws, levying forces or introducing new taxes. \nThe reason king Casimir IV Jagiellon agreed to this was the need for support in the Thirteen Years War against the Teutonic Order. While the war led towards the absorption of the Teutonic lands into Poland, the Statutes of Nieszawa laid the groundwork for the coming conflicts between the king and the szlachta."
 FEE_Poland_Events.9.OPT1: "Accept the conventions."
 FEE_Poland_Events.9.OPT2: "Refuse to sign and defy the Magnates!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.10.T: "Statutes of Piotrokow"
 FEE_Poland_Events.10.D: "Konstytucje piotrkowskie was a collection of laws passed in 1496 under king John I Olbracht who, in the tradition of his forebears, made concessions to the szlachta in exchange for their support in war. The szlachta were guaranteed certain rights, including relief from specific taxes and exclusive access to some Church offices. \nThe laws also affected the situation of peasants in the country, restricting them to their lands. After 1496, only one peasant from each village could leave per year, and only one person from a given peasant family was allowed to move to the growing towns. City burghers were also restricted from holding royal and national offices. \nFinally, the statues emphasised the rivers of Poland, removing all internal tariffs on waterways."
 FEE_Poland_Events.10.OPT1: "Enact as the szlactha require."
 FEE_Poland_Events.10.OPT2: "The king will not be forced!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.11.T: "Union of Vilnius"
 FEE_Poland_Events.11.D: "Unia krakowsko-wileñska was an attempt at taking a major step in the unification of Poland and Lithuania. It was signed by both Polish and Lithuanian nobles in 1499, and described two equal states in perpetual alliance. The countries would select their own leaders with the approval of the other, but would always support each other in armed conflicts. \nHowever, the Union did not last long in that state. Polish nobles soon began to protest it, mainly because it emphasised Lithuania as much as Poland. The reasoning they gave however, was that it was based on an old union of 1413, which they claimed there was no evidence for."
 FEE_Poland_Events.11.OPT1: "Our countries should cooperate."
 FEE_Poland_Events.11.OPT2: "Our countries are better off as just friends."

 FEE_Poland_Events.12.T: "The Privilege of Mielnik"
 FEE_Poland_Events.12.D: "The Przywilej mielnicki was an act passed by king Alexander Jagiellon in 1501, that expanded the powers of the magnates and the Sejm, to the point where it practically introduced a republican form of government. The king lost many rights, and was effectively demoted to the head of the Sejm, which held all real power. \nHowever, after being elected as head of the Sejm, the king never confirmed the priveliges, and it gradually became apparent that the struggle between the king and the greater Sejm harmed the nobles more than the new status quo helped them. \nIn 1504, the legal change was rejected by the Sejm, and while the struggle between the nobles and the king would continue for a long time, this battle had ended in Alexander's favor."
 FEE_Poland_Events.12.OPT1: "Grant the privilege."
 FEE_Poland_Events.12.OPT2: "Reject these outrageous demands!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.13.T: "The Union of Mielnik"
 FEE_Poland_Events.13.D: "The Unia mielnicka was one of the first attempts to unite Poland and Lithuania into a single state. Previously the two countries had co-existed in personal union through the king, but the Union of Mielnik would unite them into a single entity. The suggestion of the union was not well-received in Lithuania, as Polish magnates were attempting to force Polish culture and traditions onto the other country, and nobles there led a revolt against the Poles. In the end, the union was neither ratified by the Lithuanian Seimas or the Polish Sejm, and the countries remained separate in personal union for nearly seventy years more before they were finally united. "
 FEE_Poland_Events.13.OPT1: "Unite our nations under Poland. (This will cause massive revolts among the Lithuanians.)"
 FEE_Poland_Events.13.OPT2: "Don't force anyone to sign this."

 FEE_Poland_Events.14.T: "Lithuanians Revolt Against the Union"
 FEE_Poland_Events.14.D: "After the introduction of the Union of Mielnik, Lithuanian nobles have banded together in massive numbers to rise up against their Polish counterparts. Through the union, magnates have insisted on instituting Polish language in education and bureaucracy, as well as rule by Polish traditions. Now the Lithuanians have decided to fight back with arms."
 FEE_Poland_Events.14.OPT1: "You were warned."

 FEE_Poland_Events.15.T: "1504 Reforms Passed Before the King"
 FEE_Poland_Events.15.D: "In 1504, the Sejm piotrowski passed measures to restrict the king's control over the national treasury, effectively placing the Sejm in control of state funds. \nThe Sejm did not get the measures passed without negotiation, however. Nobles were from now on forbidden from holding more than a single official administrative post. In addition, Polish magnates had to return much land that had previously been seized from the king, thereby compensating somewhat for the financial authority the king lost."
 FEE_Poland_Events.15.OPT1: "You lose some, you... win some?"

 FEE_Poland_Events.16.T: "Nothing New Without the Common Consent"
 FEE_Poland_Events.16.D: "Nihil novi nisi commune consensu was an act adopted by the Sejm in 1505 at Radom. It forbade the king to issue laws without the consent of the nobility. This consent would be given through the Senat and the Chamber of Deputies. \nThe only exceptions were laws governing royal cities, crown lands, mines, fiefdoms, royal peasants, and Jews. These exceptions can be traced by the meaning of the law's name in Polish, \"Nothing About Us Without Us.\""
 FEE_Poland_Events.16.OPT1: "The nobles can be of great aid."
 FEE_Poland_Events.16.OPT2: "This is too far! No more power to the nobles!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.17.T: "The Privilege of Torun"
 FEE_Poland_Events.17.D: "Przywilej toruñski was enacted in 1520 by the Polish king, granting the szlachta greater control over people living on their lands. Peasants were forced to pay serfdom to their masters, and prevented them from leaving their villages. This was a part of the greater trend of introducing serfdom in Eastern Europe at the time, as encouraging peasant settlers was no longer considered as necessary at it had been in earlier centuries. The Privilege defined Polish serfdom for the next century, before it gradually declined under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After nearly three centuries, the state's attitude would reverse into constitutional state protection for all peasants."
 FEE_Poland_Events.17.OPT1: "Serfdom is the way of the future!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.17.OPT2: "We can't give these predatory nobles more power."

 FEE_Poland_Events.18.T: "The Prussian Homage"
 FEE_Poland_Events.18.D: "Hołd pruski was the investment of the former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order as Duke of Prussia under the Polish crown. \nPoland required every new Grand Master of the Order to pay homage to the king, and a refusal to do so had resulted in lasting conflict between the Order and Poland, culminating in the Polish-Teutonic War. The war dragged on, and with renewed incursions of the Ottomans into Christian lands, the two states agreed to an armistice that would see the Teutonic Order secularised into a Polish dukedom. In the main square of Krakow, Albert publicly resigned as Grand Master before receiving the title Duke of Prussia from King Zygmunt the Old."
 FEE_Poland_Events.18.OPT1: "Establish Prussia as a royal fief."
 FEE_Poland_Events.18.OPT2: "The Order serves our purpose."

 FEE_Poland_Events.19.T: "Tumult of Danzig"
 FEE_Poland_Events.19.D: "The Tumult gdanski was a 1525 revolt by Lutheran burghers against the mayor of Danzig, Eberhard Ferber. The mayor was suspected of defrauding money from the city under the protection of the Crown Chancellor. As the revolt developed it took on a religious tone, and even though the mayor resigned, the refusal of the Chancellor to show the city accounts meant that riots continued. \nThe Protestant burghers closed Catholic churches and introduced their own preachers to replace pastors. As the city came under their control, the commoners demanded the removal of the city from the juridistiction of the local bishop, and a delegation sent to Martin Luther asked the priest to send teachers of the new faith. \nHowever, a year after the tumult started and two months after the burghers had seized complete control of the city, King Sigismund and the prince of Pommerania led an army into the city, putting down the revolt and beheading its leaders, restoring the old order to Danzig."
 FEE_Poland_Events.19.OPT1: "These people must be stopped at all costs!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.19.OPT2: "Live and let live."

 FEE_Poland_Events.20.T: "The Treaty of Vilnius"
 FEE_Poland_Events.20.D: "The Pakt wileñski was concluded between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Livonian Confederation in 1561, during the Livonian War. With the exception of the Free Imperial City of Riga, the Treaty brought all the Livonian states that were not occupied by Denmark or Sweden under the suzerainty of the Commonwealth. It also secularised the Livonian Order into the Duchy of Courland and Semigalla and the Duchy of Livonia. \nWhile the treaty finally lost Livonia its independence, in the eyes of the Polish state it rescued the Livonian lands from Russian aggression and inevitable conquest."
 FEE_Poland_Events.20.OPT1: "Incorporate Livonia, for their own good."
 FEE_Poland_Events.20.OPT2: "We don't have the capacity to administer those lands."

 FEE_Poland_Events.21.T: "Karnkowski's Statute"
 FEE_Poland_Events.21.D: "Statut karnkowskiego was a law enacted in 1570 by Stanislav Karnkowski, the bishop of Kujawy and Great Secretary of the Crown. The law gave the Polish king full authority over all matters of the sea, with the intention of improving Poland's naval capabilities in the Baltic Sea. The act led to extensive naval development in Danzig, but had no great effect beyond that due to the death of king Sigismund II August died, and the fact that his successor had little interest in competing for naval supremacy."
 FEE_Poland_Events.21.OPT1: "Expand the rights of the king."
 FEE_Poland_Events.21.OPT2: "We don't need this."

 FEE_Poland_Events.22.T: "The Prussian Homage"
 FEE_Poland_Events.22.D: "The Prussian Homage was the investment of the former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order as the duke of the secularised Ducal Prussia, a fief under the Polish Crown. \nThis fit well with Albert of Prussia's newfound Protestantism, as it allowed Prussia to no longer be a subject of the papacy. \nIt seems that our overlord has similarly decided that it is time we came properly under their wing as a secular duchy."
 FEE_Poland_Events.22.OPT1: "Humble before the Polish King."

 FEE_Poland_Events.23.T: "The Treaty of Vilnius"
 FEE_Poland_Events.23.D: "The Pakt wileñski was concluded between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Livonian Confederation in 1561, during the Livonian War.

 FEE_Portugal_Events.1.T: "Luís de Camões"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.1.D: "The national poet of Portugal, Luís de Camões was a 16th century lyricist, so famous for his writing that Portuguese is sometimes referred to as \"the language of Camões\"\n\nFollowing a humanist education, he spent much of his life abroad, first serving willingly in Ceuta where he lost one eye in battle, before being forced to serve in the militia in Goa to avoid prison. He kept on writing as he travelled, and did not even stop as he became cheif warrant officer in Macau. His journeys were probably what inspired his most famous work, \"Os Lusíadas,\" an epic poem in the style of Homer about the Portuguese heroes of the age of exploration. The epic was mostly written in a grotto, and one story tells how de Camões was shipwrecked and swam ashore with one arm holding the poem above the water.\n\nWhile much of his work has been lost his genius was recognised in his time, and the day of his death, June 1th, is the national day of Portugal."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.1.OPT1: "A greater poet there never was and never will be again."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.T: "The Return of King Sebastian!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.D: "The line of Avis ended with the death of Sebastian the Child King on his crusade in Morocco, but the more than sixty years of Spanish rule that followed convinced many Portuguese that Sebastian was not truly dead, but would return one foggy day to free Portugal. This belief endured, and King Sebastian passed into legend as a sleeping hero, waiting for the day his country would need him again.\n\nOf course, a people expecting a savior and an evil oppressive state meant that there was no shortage of people trying to capitalise on the stories. There were no less than four impostors claiming to be Sebastian while Portugal was subject to Spain. \n\nNow a young man claiming to be Sebastian has arrived in Lisboa. What shall we do with him?"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.OPT1: "His name is Sebastian, that's good enough right now."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.OPT2: "Throw this impostor in the dungeons!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.3.T: "Spiceless!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.3.D: "With the final fall of Constantinople to the Turks came not only the end of Christian control of the Bosporus but also the expulsion of many Italian merchants hailing from a diverse and competitive array of Italian states; the only ones allowed to stay being the conniving Venetians. Ever mindful of profit over faith, those opportunistic snakes have cozied up with the Turks, abandoning all principle for their precious ducats.\n\nThe overland routes to India and the spice trade are all but cut, the lifeline that supplied us with exotic goods and spices. The Venetian monopoly may make them rich, but ultimately we are left spiceless and desperate for it, as is the rest of Europe. This situation is unacceptable!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.3.OPT1: "Well I guess we'll have to find another way to India!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.T: "The School of Sagres"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.D: "Nestled in the Southwest corner of Europe sandwiched between Spain and the Atlantic Ocean, the Portuguese people have always been natural seafarers. Lately, however, a prince in our court by the name of Dom Henrique de Viseu has put forth the idea that Portugal must secure a place on the seas in order to sail farther down the coast than any previous Europeans.\nDrawing on Portuguese tactics, cutting-edge Venetian advancements, and newly-discovered science, Henrique has proposed an unprecedented leap in royal patronage of navies. An organized school which not only teaches the sailors and admirals of tomorrow, but researches improved methods of cartography, ship design, and maritime combat. Additionally, he tells us that the royal patronage of the navy to an extent hitherto unseen in Europe will give Portugal the advantage she desperately needs in this age of discovery."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.OPT1: "Found Henry the Navigator's School!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.OPT2: "This isn't a matter for the crown."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.T: "A Rising Star"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.D: "During the bloody war of the Castilian Succession, one of our noblemen and soldiers proved a far more capable leader than anyone expected. Rallying our soldiers from almost \n\ncertain defeat, he turned what would have been annihilation into a victory. Now, his ambitions have grown along with his fame, and he has arrived at court seeking official promotion and new assignments abroad. "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.OPT1: "By all means, give him what he has deserved!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.OPT2: "That's great, kid. Don't get cocky."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.OPT3: "Such self-serving ambition is hardly worthy of our patronage!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.T: "The Shores of Africa"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.D: "Despite the inroads made by Portugal into the heart of the Moorish homeland, our control over the northern coast of Africa is being increasingly challenged by pirates and tribal raids. We have already dispatched Alfonso de Albuquerque to re-establish our control. Besides building an island fort in the area, however, he has struggled to find success. None other than Francisco de Almeida has approached us with a new and bold plan to dealing with these annoyances. A local emir has hinted that he might help us, provided we provide him with European gunpowder weaponry with which to do so. Of course, these weapons could later be used against us... \n\n"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.OPT1: "Almeida's plan is a good one!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.OPT2: "Arming our potential enemies is never wise..."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.7.T: "Emir Lends his Aid"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.7.D: "True to his word, the Emir contacted by Almeida has joined us in our efforts against the Moorish pirates!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.7.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.T: "Emir's Betrayal!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.D: "No sooner did the scoundrel Emir have our weaponry safely inside his castle than he turned them on the very ships that brought them to him! We should have known better than to trust a pirate..."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.OPT1: "We shall have his head!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.OPT2: "We must back down... for now."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.T: "To Africa!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.D: "Once again, Almeida has approached us with a proposal. While our ships are capable of getting to India with only minor difficulty, he says, it would be much easier for our merchants and sailors if we were to explore the eastern shores of Africa and set up supply depots for ships to stop at. Additionally, trade with the Africans themselves may prove of no small profit! Almeida even claims to have already identified three promising locations for Portuguese trading posts."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.OPT1: "A splendid idea! Spare no expense and send out an expedition at once!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.OPT2: "Let us not overextend; why send an armada when a few ships will do?"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.OPT3: "Let us steer clear of Africa. Who knows what trouble could lie there?"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.T: "Looking to India"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.D: "Having established a presence in Africa, we are tantalizingly close to India itself. Appreciative of Almeida's success, the crown has vested him with the title “Viceroy of India.” Of course, as we yet have little presence in India this title is mostly ceremonial. Both Almeida and the crown, however, have plans to change that, both revolving around the potentially lucrative spices of Cannanore. \n\nPast that, whether their plans are the same remains to be seen. "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.OPT1: "Let us deal diplomatically for a foothold in India, as per the crown's plan!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.OPT2: "Let us listen to Almeida and use some “persuasion”"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.T: "The Zamorin"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.D: "While our setting up of trading posts in India has so far met with great success, more than one local Hindu prince is jealous of our profits. One of the most prominent, known simply as ‘The Zamorin,' rules over the rich port of Calicut and has begun assembling an alliance against us! Rather than respecting our trade, he demands payment for all the lost trade income he blames on us having better offers than he...\n\nAlmeida wishes to meet this threat head-on at sea rather than wait for the Zamorin to come to us..."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.OPT1: "We must prepare for battle on the seas."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.OPT2: "Let us seek an alliance of our own to contain this threat."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.OPT3: "Give the Zamorin what he wants."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.T: "Almeida's Son Killed!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.D: "After Francisco de Almeida finally settled in as Viceroy of Portugal's holdings in India, tragedy struck. Francisco had sent his only son, Lourenco de Almeida, on routine expeditions of his own to secure additional trade opportunities on the Indian coast. However, news arrived back in Cannanore that Lourenco had run across an Egyptian fleet heading to India to pirate our hard-won trade! \n\nIn the resulting skirmish, Lourenco was killed. Francisco did not take this news well, and went into a deep depression and rage, vowing revenge. His men, having followed him for years through great hardship, are likely to follow him come what may. \n\nMeanwhile back in Lisbon, whispers at the royal court have begun to accuse Almeida of treason against the crown, that he only sought power from himself in India, where distance already makes him de-facto independent. No doubt these whispers are at least partly fueled by jealousy. Indeed, Almeida has been a loyal servant of Portugal since before the way to India was even discovered. However, the risk of treason is real, and it is not to be taken lightly."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.OPT1: "Clearly, Almeida is no longer fit for duty."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.OPT2: "Almeida has proven a loyal servant of the state."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.OPT3: "Lourenco's death is an unacceptable loss!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.T: "Almeida Defies the King"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.D: "Almeida's thirst for revenge was clearly greater than anyone anticipated. No sooner had Alfonso de Albuquerque landed in India as Almeida's replacement than Almeida did the unthinkable. Arresting Alfonso, he gathered a fleet and set sail on his own behalf. He promises, however, that he will return his fleet and men to the authority of Portugal as soon as his revenge is complete."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.OPT1: "He is nothing but a traitor!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.OPT2: "We have no choice but to hope he keeps his word."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.14.T: "Securing our African Interests "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.14.D: "Merchants and explorers have discovered new sources of wealth on the African continent, circumventing the Arab-controlled caravans across the Sahara. \n\nNeedless to say, established trading interests take none too kindly to our presence, and may agitate locals against us. Accordingly, merchants have asked us for our help in securing their posts on the Ivory Coast. "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.14.OPT1: "They shall receive our help."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.14.OPT2: "The merchants must take care of themselves."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.T: "Sephardic Jews Arrive in Portugal"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.D: "Portugal has long had an established, prosperous, and well-tolerated Jewish community within its borders. At times, a full 20% of the population of the Kingdom of Portugal has been Jewish. \n\nWith the final fall of the Moors in Granada came a great expulsion of the Jews throughout the realms of the Catholic Monarchs of Castile and Aragon. Many of them fled to friendly lands such as Holland. However, the presence of a strong Jewish community here has drawn the majority of them to seek asylum in Portugal. \n\nGranting them asylum in his realm might bring [Root.Monarch.GetName] many advantages. Indeed, several of the most prominent families among them have even promised gifts and skilled craftsmen for weaponry to aid [Root.Monarch.GetName] in wars against the Muslims if he lets them in. \n\nAt the same time, tension between Jews and Christians in Portugal is never far from the surface, and an influx of Jewish refugees may spark a crisis."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.OPT1: "Accept their gifts and grant them full toleration."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.OPT2: "Admit them into our realm in exchange for military aid."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.15.OPT3: "We do not need to risk the wrath of Castile or of our own people."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.16.T: "Expulsion of the Jews?"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.16.D: "There is no question that the Jewish refugees who settled in Portugal from Castile have become very successful. In fact, [Root.Monarch.GetName] considers them an essential part of the Portuguese economy. \n\nHowever, their success has caused heightened tension from non-Jewish Portuguese citizens who feel slighted by the Jews' success. Now, a group of clergy and middle-class Christians has arrived at court, along with indignant diplomats from our neighbors, demanding that we cease allowing the Jews to live freely among us."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.16.OPT1: "Expel the Jews and confiscate their wealth!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.16.OPT2: "Attempt to Convert the Jews to Christianity so they can stay!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.16.OPT3: "The King will not be bullied into abusing his subjects!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.17.T: "Securing Malacca Trade"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.17.D: "Having conquered the famous port of Malacca, the merchants in charge of the trading feitoria there expected to seize the same control of the spice trade that the Malaccans themselves had once enjoyed. However, they soon found out that without the centralized bureaucracy and navy from the Malacca Sultans, the importance of the port was greatly diminished. Portuguese merchants now had to compete with a host of smaller ports instead of profiting from Malacca's fabled riches. Action must be taken if we are to received the benefits from the city that our admirals promised us when we set out to take it."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.17.OPT1: "We must spare no expenses to revive the city!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.17.OPT2: "Shouldn't these merchants be helping us rather than complaining?"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.18.T: "Portuguese Arrivals in Japan"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.18.D: "Our first arrivals on the fabled isles of Japan were met with a curious mixture of respectful awe and bewildered disdain. Despite this, however, we were received hospitably, and our hosts' face lit up when we began to describe our weaponry to him! \n\nAfter several days of demonstrating our firearms, including not only their usage but a description of the various parts involved and even how to clean them properly. The local lord of the place, called Satsuma, was most eager to obtain these weapons, and promised well-made swords, silks, and chinaware in exchange for a steady supply of weapons."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.18.OPT1: "By all means, let the trade commence!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.18.OPT2: "These seems too risky, we'd best not meddle in local warfare like this."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.T: "Ferdinand Magellan"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.D: "An ambitious explorer has arrived at our court seeking an audience, named Ferdinand Magellan. He has already distinguished himself on discovery missions for both the Spanish and Portuguese crowns, including in the now-famous expeditions of Francisco de Almeida. He proposes a new scheme for sailing to the Spice Islands, one where we avoid the tumultuous African and Indian Ocean waters altogether and sail around the southern tip of America instead. Not only would this potentially be a better route to the Spice Islands, he argues, but would also provide the chance to discover yet more new and rich lands beyond the South Atlantic. \n\nRemembering how the Portuguese crown rejected the plans of Christopher Columbus to their everlasting sorrow, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is most reluctant to reject Magellan's plan. However, going under South America also risks violating the Treaty of Tordesillas, angering the Spanish and giving them cause for war."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.OPT1: "Allow him to set out at once!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.OPT2: "Best to keep him here to further our own interests without angering Spain."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.19.OPT3: "We already have the route to the Spice Islands well-established, we need no more."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.20.T: "Societas Jesu in Asia"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.20.D: "As Europe is rocked by Reformation and Counter-Reformation, the effort to spread the Catholic faith outside of Europe itself has grown apace. \n\nFrom one of our garrisons in India comes news that none other than Francis Xavier, co-founder of the Societas Jesu, has arrived. He wishes first to purify the faith among the Portuguese there, who he finds altogether too focused on wealth and too lax in their faith, and then from there spread the faith to all of our holdings in Asia. Xavier wishes for us to allow him leave to bring yet more Jesuits from Spain into our realm, or else set up our own Inquisition to help him reach his goal. \n\nNaturally, this might bite into our profits, but Xavier and many devout voices insist that this is a worthy sacrifice for the glory of God."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.20.OPT1: "No one expected the Portuguese Inquisition!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.20.OPT2: "Allow the Jesuits to pursue their missionary efforts unmolested."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.20.OPT3: "Keep them out of our trading posts, we don't need them stirring up trouble."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.21.T: "Sugar Cultivation in Brazil"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.21.D: "Once a luxury only imported over harsh land routes from the East, sugarcane has found a favorable climate in our new colonies and is proving to be more profitable than anyone could have imagined as it becomes accessible to the public for the first time. \nOur colony in Brazil especially is beginning to find great success in growing this crop. Let's hope no one steals our success..."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.21.OPT1: "Sweet!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.101.OPT1: "Please report it to the team if you see it."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.101.T: "The Jews of Portugal"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.101.D: "Our tolerance of Jewish settlers and immigrants, either fleeing persecution or freely settling in the Portugese valleys and hills have brought us to a breaking point. The Jews now have a large influence over the courts and administration of our Empire and much of our countryside is comprised of large Jewish villages and towns. Many are urging us to decide wether or not we should further this development and fully embrace the Jewish Faith. This would be very beneficial to us but would of course anger much of our Catholic population."

 FEE_Renaissance_Events.1.D: "Over the course of a century, intellectual life on the Italian peninsula has seen stronger and stronger influences from the knowledge rediscovered in the ancients, Greek and Roman writers, philosophers, and orators, from Plato to Cicero. This development has largely happened in the interest of the public good, that a well-educated populace might better safeguard our civilisation than one could in the barbaric Middle Ages separating us from those glorious times. \nThese principles have become pervasive in our society, and carries influence not just in philosophy and humanist teachings, but in art and architecture, law and warfare. \nOver time, this will make our nation strong and our people indomitable, in the realm of the temporal as well as the spiritual."
 FEE_Renaissance_Events.1.OPT1: "As $COUNTRY$ looks to the past, $COUNTRY$ looks to the future."

 FEE_Renaissance_Events.2.T: "Renaissance Influences in $COUNTRY$"
 FEE_Renaissance_Events.2.D: "Spreading from Italy and across Europe, the cultural \"rebirth\" of the ancient Greeks and Romans brings with it new ways of thinking about the world we live in. They give us a new understanding of how we relate to other people, in ways that changes politics as much as it changes art. While encompassing a multitude of cultural movements, expressed in a multitude of ways in different places, there are a few cire tenets bringing continuity to our cultural age. \nThese principles have become pervasive in our society, and carries influence not just in philosophy and humanist teachings, but in art and architecture, law and warfare. \nOver time, this will make our nation strong and our people indomitable, in the realm of the temporal as well as the spiritual."

 FEE_Renaissance_Events.3.D: "As there was no moment that marked the beginning, there is no moment to mark the end. No great event, no grand last stand. As the principles guiding art and philosophy for the last century or more fades in relevance, there is no one to take notice.

 FEE_Russia_Events.1.D: "The grand city of St. Petersburg has served as the capital of all Russia for years, being the gateway to the Baltic's riches for both our merchants and our admirals; through it has flowed Russian culture and influence for many years. Unfortunately, the capital lies in a dangerous strategic position, for as the riches of Scandinavia and Germany flow into St. Petersburg, so do their dangers. The Gulf of Finland is easily traversable by enemy fleets, and currently any aggressor against us may sail straight into the heart of our capital, into the heart of Russia itself. There is a way to defend the city, however. Kotlin Island stands between the mouth of the Neva and the Gulf proper, meaning all ships coming to harbour at the capital must pass it. Our engineers have proposed a large fortress, to be built on Kotlin Island, which would stand proudly amongst the sea, a great bastion which all enemies must defeat to negotiate safe passage to St. Petersburg!

 FEE_Venice_Events.1.T: "The Venetian Fleet"
 FEE_Venice_Events.1.D: "A new phase for the Venetian navy began in 1453, with the fall of Constantinople and the start of the centuries-old confrontation with the Turks. Faced with the growing threat to its maritime possessions, we are faced with the choice of constituting a real permanent naval navy, with dozens of galleys operating in peacetime and an appreciable force of more than one hundred galleys in the event of war."
 FEE_Venice_Events.1.OPT1: "We must create a new mercantile fleet."
 FEE_Venice_Events.1.OPT2: "Galleys are safer."
 FEE_Venice_Events.1.OPT3: "We can't afford either right now."

 FEE_Venice_Events.2.T: "Magistrato alla Milizia da Mar"

"
 FEE_Venice_Events.2.OPT1: "Gloria a San Marco!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.3.T: "Naval Reform"
 FEE_Venice_Events.3.D: "At the same time, the spread of firearms gradually led to arming the galleys no longer with traditional Greek fire, but with artillery positioned at the bow and able to fire in the direction of the ship's advance. In the same period, new types of ships were developed: \n The brig, a small and fast ship, similar to a galley, for escort and transport services. About 20 m long and 3 m wide, for about 14 banks. \n The Galeotta, a small ship similar to a galley, but faster and more maneuverable. About 25 m long and 4 m wide, for about 15 banks. \n The Fusta, a small thin galley. About 35 m long and 5 m wide, for about 20 banks. \n The bastard galley, with larger dimensions and fuller stern shapes than the thin galley, capable of acting as a captain or patroness, that is, as a flagship."
 FEE_Venice_Events.3.OPT1: "Reforms will come."

 FEE_Venice_Events.4.T: "Governator de' Condannati"
 FEE_Venice_Events.4.D: "In the sixteenth century, the traditional small throwing weapons (bows and crossbows) were gradually replaced on board ships with more modern arquebuses. Also in the same period as the traditional free galleys, whose crews of convicts were composed of the so-called buonavoglia (i.e. free men recruited for pay) and zontaroli (i.e. debtors and convicts, who thus paid off their debt, or conscripts for the need for war), the first sforzate galleys began to join forces, that is, moved exclusively by convicts condemned to forced labor at the oars. The use of this type of ship, however, always remained rather limited in the Venetian navy, so much so that they did not even fall within the normal hierarchy of the fleet and constituted a separate flotilla, dependent on the so-called Governator de 'Condannati."
 FEE_Venice_Events.4.OPT1: "The Commander shall lead them."

 FEE_Venice_Events.5.T: "Porta di Terra"
 FEE_Venice_Events.5.D: "After the fall of Constantinople (1453) and the consequent threat posed by the Ottoman fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, the arsenal underwent important works of war strengthening and productive structures; to commemorate these works, the monumental Porta di Terra (Porta da Tera) or Porta Magna was erected. The portal, built between 1457 and 1460 on the model of the Roman triumphal arches, became the first example of Renaissance architecture in the city."
 FEE_Venice_Events.5.OPT1: "Marvelous!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.6.T: "Arsenal Expansion"
 FEE_Venice_Events.6.D: "Starting from 1473 and for a century until 1573, the third major phase of development of the arsenal took place, in which the last extensions were made by merging various surrounding marshy lands, with the construction of external residences for workers, public ovens and warehouses for cereals (the Darsena Nuovissima) and Galeazze, which led the arsenal to cover an area of almost 24 hectares."
 FEE_Venice_Events.6.OPT1: "Marble, Honour and Virtue."

 FEE_Venice_Events.7.T: "Espansione dell'Arsenale del 1535"
 FEE_Venice_Events.7.D: "through the appropriation of an area owned by the convent of Celestia, at the north-western end of the Arsenale Nuovissimo, placing the activities related to the gunpowder processing and storage; the area was connected to the Arsenale Vecchio, after having acquired other land from the same convent, which brought the already large area dedicated to dust from 5000 to 7800 m² overall. A new facade was erected for the Volto del Bucintoro, expanding the square to accommodate the ceremonial boat of the same name, rebuilt between 1525 and 1526. Later on, was built, close to the walls overlooking the Rio of San Daniele, the artillery workshop - a building about 180 m long, still existing - and the fifteenth-century arms rooms were renovated. The close collaboration between artillerymen, smelters and manufacturers of powders, inside and outside the arsenal, contributed to the affirmation of the Venetian war industry, at the forefront in Europe for almost two centuries, with the invention of lethal weapons such as shooting mortars curved, huge siege bombards, culverins, falcons and battle falconets. A decree of the Commission of Ten and the Superintendent of Artillery of 1565 explicitly refers to the presence of "artillery factories" distributed in various warehouses in the arsenal."

 FEE_Venice_Events.8.T: "Espansione Finale dell'Arsenale"
 FEE_Venice_Events.8.D: "Between 1566 and 1573 the last phase of resumption of the works was carried out in the Arsenale Nuovissimo, with new covered yards in the Isolotto and two large aquatic yards (\"water faces\") at the reeds or Gaggiandre; between 1566 and 1568 the tezon of sieghe and timber was built facing west, towards the Galeazze canal and next to the Novissimetta, where the Squadratori building is located, overlooking a small basin for the conservation of oak wood. In 1569 there was a powerful explosion of dust in the Celestia area, causing extensive damage to the walls, some building sites and the Celestia convent. A fifth extension dates back to the same period, with the excavation of the dock of the Galeazze, covering yards for the construction of this new type of battleship, which proved to be decisive for obtaining victory during the numerous naval battle.\n The construction of the small temple of the Madonna of the Arsenale leaning against the eastern tower of the Arsenale water gate; later on the architect Antonio da Ponte rebuilt the building of the Corderie; the monumental access portal to the arms rooms and to the artillery workshop that closes the Stradal de Campagna was built."

 FEE_Venice_Events.13.D: "With the battle of Agnadello numerous Jews from the hinterland (there were various communities between Vicenza and Conegliano) poured into the city to escape the abuses of the army of the League of Cambrai.

 FEE_Venice_Events.14.T: "Ghetto Novo"
 FEE_Venice_Events.14.D: "On March 29, 1516, the government of the Serenissima (which would never have admitted an expulsion, given the economic importance of the community) put a hand to this situation by concentrating the Jews in the Ghetto Novo, an islet where a foundry once existed and which then housed a residential neighborhood. The inhabitants were then evicted to allow Jews to be imprisoned in a Ghetto. The only two entrances to the island, the bridges over the Rio di San Girolamo and the Rio del Ghetto, were closed at night and were guarded by Christian guardians, paid by the Jews themselves. \n The first inhabitants of the Ghetto Nuovo were the Jews of the Tokesca nation (Ashkenazi), which had the obligation to manage pawn shops. The Israelites were allowed few other professions: strazzarìa, or the second-hand trade, and medicine (doctors were allowed to leave the Ghetto at night to visit their patients)."
 FEE_Venice_Events.14.OPT1: "Erect the Ghetto."
 FEE_Venice_Events.14.OPT2: "Execute them."

 FEE_Venice_Events.15.T: "The Levantini Family"
 FEE_Venice_Events.15.D: "In 1541 the Serenissima granted the Ghetto Vecchio (a neighborhood adjacent to the Ghetto Novo) to the Levantini, a group made up of merchants from the Ottoman Empire. The Venetian economy certainly took advantage of this event, troubled by the wars against the Turks and by the increased competition from the port of Ancona. The Levantines had different obligations than the Germans: they did not deal with loans but were traders. This nation had decidedly particular habits: they exhibited sumptuous and oriental robes, with turbans and ornaments, decidedly contrasting with the modest German Jews."
 FEE_Venice_Events.15.OPT1: "You are welcome!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.16.T: "Il Ridotto"
 FEE_Venice_Events.16.D: "As the original European casino, Il Ridotto was a government-owned gambling house that formalized gambling and excessive money loss in Venice in 1638. It was established once the Great Council gave up on preventing people from playing for money during the Carnivale.

 FEE_Venice_Events.17.D: "Son of Nicolò di Giovanni Foscari and Caterina di Giovanni Michiel, Franesco was of the Foscari family, one of the "Case Nuove", the patrician Venetian families which ascended during the Late Middle Age. In 1400 he joined the Quarantia, and the following year the judges of his own; in 1403 the Saviours to the Orders and then became Avogador. When Tomasso Mocenigo died on the 4th of April 1423 Francesco competed for the supreme magistracy against five other candidates, all more mature than himself, among whom Pietro Loredan excelled on the ballot. By exploiting his partisans within the electoral college, Foscari managed to bring his competitors into disrepute, all while Venice was at war with Milan in the Guerre di Lombardia."

 FEE_Venice_Events.21.D: "My son Jacopo, the only one that survived the Peste of 1430s has already been accused of treachery against the Republic when on 18 February 1445, the Council of Ten imprisoned him on the charge of colluding with foreign princes. Foscari, however, had managed to save himself by fleeing to Trieste. Two days later the Ten banished him from Venice in perpetuity, condemning him to exile in Nauplia. The super-command Marco Trevisan was then sent to Trieste to execute the sentence and on 3 March the Dogaressa was forbidden to travel to Julian city to visit her son. In fact, according to historical documents, it seems that the Council had acted with a certain mildness perhaps due to pressure from the doge and his family. The Trevisan left for Trieste no earlier than 25 February and in any case did not succeed in capturing the Foscari since on 11 March the doge was asked to induce his son to turn himself in. In the following months, the Dieci was substantially inert and only on 28 November 1446 was the confinement at Nauplia converted with that at Zelarino, a Venetian locality very close to the Lagoon of which the Foscari were feudal lords. Finally, on 13 September 1447, the Dieci granted a pardon. \n\nA today the Ten came back to deal with him: he was now accused of entertaining correspondence with Francesco Sforza and even Muhammad II. On 12 June, therefore, the super-committee Lorenzo Loredan was sent to Chania. He brought Foscari back to Venice where, on 24 July, the Council gave him the mildest sentence, i.e. confirmation of his Cretan exile. The doge and the young man's family were also allowed to visit him in prison."

A state funeral was arranged for him with an exhibition to the people in ducal vestments, despite the opposition of his widow, who saw it as a clumsy act of reparation by that power that had taken away her son and humiliated her husband. The body was accompanied by the new doge [Root.Monarch.GetName] who appeared in the simple guise of a senator. Francesco Foscari was buried in the presbytery of the basilica of the Frari, in the mausoleum made for him by Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino, in an urn supported by four graceful corbels adorned with the three theological virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity) in whose arrangement around the sarcophagus Niccolò modified the conventional and static arrangement of the personifications, transforming it into a drama inserted in the flow of time. The crowning figure of the Saviour changed the common motif of the Risen Christ into the image of the Ascension of Christ taken from the Venetian duchy, as an allusion to the true ruler of Venice, to whom alone his representative - the doge - was responsible."
