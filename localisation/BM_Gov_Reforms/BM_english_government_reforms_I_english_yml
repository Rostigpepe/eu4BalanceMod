curia_regis_english_desc:0 "The Curia Regis, or Kings Council, was the title of the council that served the early French kings, and was imported to the English courts following the Norman conquest. If we introduce it we might use it to counterweigh the Nobles and use its power to tax, judge and weaken their might."

abolish_bastard_feudalism_english_desc:0 "Bastard Feudalism centred not the financial aspects (the sums involved were mostly negligible) but on the concept of service in exchange for good favour. IN a society governed on a personal basis, service to a lord was the best way to obtain favour in the form of offices, grants, and barronship. Lords would retain administrators and lawyers, as well as recruiting local gentry into their affinities. By offering money instead of land, lords could afford to retain more followers. In return for becoming retainers, the gentry would expect to rely on their lord's influence in local and national politics. This practice was known as 'maintenance'. The retainer might wear his lord's livery badge or the grander form, a livery collar, which could be very useful in a courtroom. Under a weak king, the rivalries of magnates might spill over from the courtroom to armed confrontations, thereby perverting justice."

henrician_reforms_english:0 "Henrician Reforms"
henrician_reforms_english_desc:0 "Following the continued rise of militarism in the French, Spanish, and Imperial German states, the English crown had a standing army of a few hundred men and a couple of fort garrisons. The Lord's and Nobles were expected, but not obligated, to supply their Vassal and March armies to service the crown during war. This caused the English army to be outnumbered, and the few soldiers that were supplied were armed with billhooks and crossbows, rather then muskets and pikes. The Henrician Reforms was the creation of a much extended army and navy, re-organizing the militia system and creating a series of coastal forts against potential invasions."

the_supreme_governor_english_desc:0 "The Supreme Governor of the Church of England was first used as a title by Queen Elizabeth of England and Ireland. This title was used as a compromise between the pro-papal and pro-anglican factions in England. The Governor title both established her rule and dominion over the Anglican church, unlike the title of 'Head of Church', it doesn't challenge the rule of the Pope directly, as well as sementing her position as a woman. In addition to this, the highly pragmatic sense of Elizabeth and her successors left enough space for talented people to serve regardless of their religious uniformity. Those who didn't wish to conform to this pragmatism where free to seek their fortune elsewhere, like the New World."

tariffs_trading_rights_english_desc:0 "There is nothing in the world more lucrative than trade, and we intend to capitalize on it. With the expansion of global trade routes, especially with the Triangle Trade, merchants are starting to sell and buy their goods and wares less in line with national interests, and more according to personal profitability. To not let our imports overtake our exports, putting us in a position of current account deficit, we are going to heavily tax imported goods, whilst reducing tax on our exports. We will also tax our colonial possessions to utilise all our assets in our economical reach."
