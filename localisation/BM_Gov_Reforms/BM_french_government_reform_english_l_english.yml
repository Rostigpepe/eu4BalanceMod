BM_the_rise_of_bourgeoisie_aristocracy_reform:0 "The Rise of the Bourgeoisie Aristocracy"
BM_the_rise_of_bourgeoisie_aristocracy_reform_desc:0 "In the wake of the Hundred Years War, and the great plagues that followed, many nobles were serving as knights in wars and fielded large peasant levies. Due to the fact that during war people often die, many noble estates died out or fell into decline, forced by royal collectors to sell their lands and estates to the new-born bourgheoisie aristocracy. This had the effect that previous Noble Aristocracy lost their sway over their respective lands and the new Bourgeoisie Aristocracy took over, bringing a new praxis of feudalism to France."
