 BM_council_of_sheikhs_andalus_desc:0 "Since the days of the Almohad dynasty, the Caliph has held a council of sheikhs of the tribes and peoples under his hegemony. We should re-instate this council in order to fill our need for troops and control."

 BM_taifa_governors_andalus_desc:0 "The historic shattering of Al-Andalushas led to the formation of Taifas, feudal muslim lords who fought against each other for dominance over the Andalusian Emirate. If we organize our nation across the Taifa borders, and use some of their old infrastructure, we can have our autonomous vassals raise much bigger armies than normal vassals and marches ever could."

 BM_taha_divisions_andalus_desc:0 "In the early days of the Muslim expansion into Iberia, lands governed by the Emir were divided between the Berber soldiers, often concentrating into 'Tahas', a small town with a hillside fort. This both expedited defense and offense as the continued conquests into Iberia continued."
