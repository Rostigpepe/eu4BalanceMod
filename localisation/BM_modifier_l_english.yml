bm_the_amber_trade_desc:0 "Amber has always been an important item of exchange of the people living in the Baltic Sea coast. As early as in the antiquity, Amber was valuable and sought after beyond the Baltic Sea, especially in the Roman Empire, where it was used for decorating amphitheaters and jewellery. Ever since the Teutonic and Livonian orders gained control of the Eastern Baltic, the Orders have become rich through Amber Monopoly. Now, however, as gold, silver and other various gems become more refined, made into precious jewels and church decorations, the value of the Amber has been steadily declining for 200 years. After more than 5 millennia, the fossilised tree resin that has been appreciated for its colour and natural beauty has faded into insignificance."
