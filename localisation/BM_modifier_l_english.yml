bm_the_amber_trade:0 "The Amber Trade"
bm_the_amber_trade_desc:0 "Amber has always been an important item of exchange of the people living in the Baltic Sea coast. As early as in the antiquity, Amber was valuable and sought after beyond the Baltic Sea, especially in the Roman Empire, where it was used for decorating amphitheaters and jewellery. Ever since the Teutonic and Livonian orders gained control of the Eastern Baltic, the Orders have become rich through Amber Monopoly. Now, however, as gold, silver and other various gems become more refined, made into precious jewels and church decorations, the value of the Amber has been steadily declining for 200 years. After more than 5 millennia, the fossilised tree resin that has been appreciated for its colour and natural beauty has faded into insignificance."

bm_toledo_steel:0 "Toledo Steel"
bm_toledo_steel_desc:0 "Toledo has since ancient Hispania been famous for its forging, production and uniqueness of swords. Around the 15th and 16th century, Toledo became the centre of high-quality smithmaking and swordsmanship in Europe, the Greater Middle East, and after the re-conquista, the greatest in the world. And while Toledo steel set the standard for excellence in quality of European swords, there were also very few locales that surpassed Toledo in terms of production volume. As armies began to replace swords with firearms, the blacksmithing tradition at large began its decline. In an attempt to preserve the techniques, methods and quality of the Toledo Steel production, the Spanish King Carlo III ordered the creation of the Royal Sword Factory in Toledo, further continuing the value of Toledo Steel."

bm_moroccan_rug_desc:0 "The tradition of carpets & rug-making in Morocco is just about as old as it is anywhere in the world. Most major cities have a unique style or design characteristic that distinguishes their carpets from others. Though many cities are home to many skilled embroidery studios and dye workers, perhaps the most important carpet- and rug-producing city in Morocco is Fez. The City reached its golden age during the 13th centry, at that point, the city was home to over one hundred dye workers and thousands of artisan embroidery studios located in the city's medina, city centres and old-town markets."
