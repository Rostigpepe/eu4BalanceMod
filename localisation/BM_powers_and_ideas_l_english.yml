The inititates were required to defend the cross and fight enemies of Christianity, especially the Ottoman turks. Though declining in importance as time went on and the crusades died off, their legacy gives our troops and military a zeal unlike those around us.

It is time to institute the 'Decretum Maius' and officially cut down the power of the palatine in favour of the county magistrates. The Decretum Maius provides our magistrates the authority to bring misdeeds and corruption to light without reprimands from vengeful nobles. It is rumoured our monarch has even taken this job upon himself, disguised as a magistrate with a partial mask to cover his true identity, fighting to root out corruptive elements in our judicial system, and to uncover treacherous, plotting Nobles."

During the Hussite Wars, and ultimately under the tactical genius of Jan Žižka, firearms became a widely disptributed and manufactured weapon, used by the Hussite militias and during the Hussite resurgence. Hand-held píštala's, light-weight houfnice's, rifle-hákovnice's, and heavy blunderbuss-tarasnice's are all firearms that came into use by the Czech Hussites. Because of this, the Hussite Wars and Bohemia itself is considered the origin of modern firearm-warfare."

Tulips, and specifically their bulbs, have reached extraordinarily high prices ever since.

In stock exchanges, market speculators are selling future tulips not yet grown, tulip-contracts are being exchanged up to 5 times for an ever-increasing speculation price, and our export of tulips is quickly overtaking any other of our goods being sold. Some are even selling their homes to afford tulips, and merchants and bankers are fixing their exchange rate on the price of tulips. This ever growing demand of tulips is creating a massive frenzy in the tulip markets and it doesn't look like it will calm down anytime soon. Some insiginificant sceptics are raising concern on the rationality of this tulip mania, some even dare mention the fact that that if not enough tulips can be grown, or a river flood damages the tulip fields, that demand cannot be met and the whole thing will come crashing down. Dissenters raising these concerns are clearly plotting our downfall and must be silenced. The tulip economy can never fail!"

The notion of Mansabdars has been floated around by many of our administration, but it is only recently that many are waking up to the fact that such a system would do us very well. These Mansabdars, who are traditionally in charge of military matters, high civil offices, and provincial governance, will serve the Mughal Empire well into the future.

The various Muslim leaders and officials were right not to force conversions upons the Hindus, Jains and Buddhists they came across, but they did nothing more beyond simply tolerating those outside of Islam in this diverse land.

Yet, we are ambitious enough to pursue these architectural goals with our influx of Persian architects and engineers. By combining them with the native Hindustani styles, the Indo-Islamic architecture that we are cultivating will be what future generations look upon in awe."

Starting as conquerors of the Turko-Mongols with Timur Lane with an ambition to restore the Mongol Empire, we rode across the central asian steppe into the heartlands of Persia, establishing ourselves as the rulers of the region. Now that we have have established ourselves in the Indian subcontintent, it is important that we do not repeat the same mistakes of the Mongol Khans in China, growing fat and lazy in their walled cities, letting the native customs and traditions succumb and infect their minds and soul. We are rulers, we are conquerors, we are raiders and riders, and we are the true heirs of the Mongol Empire and Genghis Khan!"

Whilst our administration might struggle to keep up with how high our internal development is growing, we will be sure to profit greatly from this rising tide of industrial output.

These vast lands of Siberia would be far more useful if we were to annex them into Russia, slowly developing them over time and extracting what resources they have so that the more prosperous parts of Russia can grow even more."

 taming_of_the_steppe_desc:0 "Wether it is the steppe near the mouth of the Dnieper River or the steppe that is east of it, we have been plagued by steppe nomads for several decades now. Russian cities like Moscow, Ryazan and Tver have historically seen countless raids by these fiends in the past, and the old power structures were not able to withstand the onslaught of these ruthless marauders. Russia, however, she is a far different state than those of old. We will utilize our technological superiority as well as the rage of 300-years and exact revenge on these unruly steppe hordes. There will be an end to their terror, and it will be the Russian flag that stands atop their burned out settlements."

 russian_winter:0 "Russian Winter!"
 russian_winter_desc:0 "The Winter in Russia has always been an indifferent, cruel and deadly force of nature for as long as anyone can remember, claiming anyone who dared be unprepared for it. By using the harsh winter and cold climate to our advantage during wars, tactics such as razing food supplies, fields, and villages, depriving our enemies of shelter and food, letting them starve and freeze to death, we hardly have to do any fighting ourselves. When the enemy armies are frozen cold, dying of starvation and begging to return, in their most weakened state, that's when we strike! "

The relationship between these two groups are often symbiotic, even though some rivalry does exist between them, their ultimate cooperation is what paves the way forward for the Persian Empire."

Many great internal and external forces have tried to establish themselves in the region only to crumble like sand against the tides of time. Alexander the Great, the Roman Empire, the Achaemenid Empire, Genghis Khan, Timur Lane, and the Persian Empire. However, unlike all other empires, Persia has both risen and fallen many times, only to stand back on its feet time and time again. This constant re-birth of Persia shows that Persia, no matter how many times it falls, will always rise like a Phoenix, time and time again."

 found_the_ghulams_desc:0 "The Persian army has traditionally been levied from nobles or foreign powers, but with Abba's army reforms, the decision to create a standirng army is clear. The new standing army is to be composed mainly of our conquered Georgian, Armenian, Circassian, and Caucasian subjects. Inspired by Ottoman Janissaries, by converting our Caucasian subjects, teaching and training them in military service as well as issuing them positions as governors of crown provinces, we can create a large, trained and most importantly, loyal army."

 fires_flames_force_desc:0 "The Persian Empire has always been born from flame, rising and growing in power, only to wither and fall to ash, but in that ash, the embers of the Empire is relit and reborn like a Phoenix, sparking into fire and burning bright again. Being placed in a melting pot of cultures, religions, traditions, trade and people, many foreign powers wonder how the Persian Empire can rise like it always does. It is through our integration of these many aspects of cultures, religions and traditions that we burn bright, and every time we fall into ash we are reborn with a new-found flame like the ever-burning kindling fires throughout our ancient ancestors homelands. Forever-again shall Persia fall, and forever-again shall we rise!"

The famed glory of the Romans, and our dwindling treasury, attracts foreign mercenaries who are willing to fight as auxiliary troops and as garrisons in our guard towers and forts. Though our most important ports and shipyards have been conquered, we still hold on to a significant navy. If we are to rebuild back to what we once were, we are going to need to rely on both mercenaries and our navy alike."

The traditional composition was done away with due to massive losses at Manzikert and Dyrrachion and instead a new army was composed of more disciplined and professional contingents like the vestiaritai, the vardariotai, and the archontopouloi. Looking back to this time of restructuring in the military gives us not only a solid foundation to replicate through various means."

Through staunch efforts from every part of Byzantium, we will rise to the glory and strive for a righteous retaking of what is rightfully ours; The Roman Empire"
